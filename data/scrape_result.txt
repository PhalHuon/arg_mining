They've lied on so many thing it's crazy:

Shereen Abu Akleh

The 40 beheaded babies (they also got Biden to lie about it)

The flour massacre

The al-shifa hospital incident in which an Israeli impersonated an al-Shifa doctor along with the edited video after Nov 2023 siege

The al-Ahli hospital faked voice call

The 15 executed aid workers 

Hamas stealing aid (turns out an israeli funded gang did it)

The many, many times of "Palewood" lies (in which they later retacted/got debunked)

The gaza ministry of health being lies

The numbers of Hamas millitants dead (American intelligence and independent org says it is way less, and the number they claim is actually the number of males &gt;15)

Hamas shooting people trying to get aid 

The white phosphorus

Even things that should be trusted like the clips they send I just cant trust

1 : New_General3939Comment: War is full of propaganda. This is true of every war ever, winning the global public opinion battle is a big part of every war. You can’t trust most of what the Palestinians are saying either, especially if it came straight from Hamas. All you can do is find a third party news source you trust (which is getting harder and harder), or try to patch together the real story with videos and individual stories from both sides.

--------------------
3 : Kman17Comment: So a really basic question for you is this: if you do not trust Israel, what is your source of truth there? What makes you think it is free from bias?

To simplify a little bit, there are basically four categories of sources here:

* What Israel says 
* What the US says
* What ‘international’ entities (comprised of mostly European and Middle Eastern interests) say
* What Palestine says 

Those four entities are in order of “everything Israel says is true” to “everything Israel says is false”.

The U.S. generally sides more with Israel but critiques, and Middle East influenced European agencies generally sides more with a Palestine but critiques.

The most probable reality is somewhere between the U.S. and EU assessment - and most of them have a more mixed assessment on all the topics you raised.

No entity here is free from bias. The NPOs and “international” entities have plenty.

There is a very, very basic truth here which is that Hamas *does* use un-uniformed soldiers, and they *do* hide amongst civilians. Like that’s not a debate.

That in turn makes every single incident a he said she said, where no one has correct intel but everyone has a narrative.

You must also recognize that Palestines strategy *is* a PR war. They instigated Israel in a way that absolutely necessitated military response, and their goal is to use the response in court of opinion to weaken Israeli alliances. That is also just undeniable.

Be careful with social media accounts. There’s this temptation to think Reddit / TikTok / whatever are delivering unfiltered news from the ground, but those are astroturfed like crazy by state level actors pumping out Palestinian propaganda.

I would not want to suggest you review is you should read evey Israeli statement as gospel truth - there’s obviously a slant.

But you shouldn’t assume that the moment you find hyperbole or incorrect report it means that the side becomes entirely untrustworthy and by extension the other side becomes definitionally  right.

4 : t1r3dddComment: Highly reputable news sources like Reuters and AP reported about the strange findings they made when they analyzed the numbers that the Gaza ministry of health had been putting out for a while, and came to the conclusion that they artificially bumped the numbers of dead women and children up, only to correct them after a few months.


I also remember being well awake looking at the live coverage of the supposed "Israeli attack" on the al-Ahli hospital, where the Gaza ministry of health quickly released a recorded press conference/message in front of what seemed like a bunch of dead covered bodies, claiming that it bad been an Israeli attack that killed about 500 people. This was immediately retracted and walked back just a few hours later as journalists could see the affected area in broad daylight, realising that not only was the hospital not damaged, but the actual missile/rocket had landed on a parking lot, and of course, no evidence of the "500 dead people" that was initially reported. It was also later reported that the rocket did not come from the IDF, but was a faulty rocket by PIJ.


This isn't to say that Israel has been 100% transparent or truthful, they obviously haven't, but this doesn't warrant any more legitimacy or credibility to Hamas and what they report.
--------------------
--------------------
5 : Appropriate_Gate_701Comment: &gt;Shereen Abu Akleh

Israel said that they likely didn't kill her, but that they'd investigate.  Then they completed the investigation and found that they accidentally killed her.

&gt;The 40 beheaded babies (they also got Biden to lie about it)

Not the Israeli government, but people responding and reporting on it being misinterpreted.  There were beheaded babies, and there were burned babies.  But there weren't 40 beheaded babies.

&gt;The flour massacre

A whole bunch of people ran on an aid convoy and were shot at by people protecting the aid convoy.  This is a tragedy, but also why you don't attack an aid convoy.

&gt;Hamas stealing aid (turns out an israeli funded gang did it)

That's not true.  Hamas has been stealing aid.  Other groups have also been stealing aid.  There's been a lot of stealing aid.  Which explains the fact that people were running at an aid convoy and that the convoys were heavily armed.

&gt;The many, many times of "Palewood" lies (in which they later retacted/got debunked)

Let's have some examples.

&gt;The numbers of Hamas millitants dead (American intelligence and independent org says it is way less, and the number they claim is actually the number of males &gt;15)

You're just spitballing

&gt;Hamas shooting people trying to get aid

This literally happened.  For the reasons listed above.  Whoever controls aid controls the strip.  Hamas losing control of the aid has led them to attack Gazans who are trying to get aid elsewhere and not pay Hamas's exorbitant prices on food and supplies that should be free.

&gt;The white phosphorus

This didn't happen
--------------------
--------------------
6 : SupervisorSCADAComment: &gt;The 40 beheaded babies (they also got Biden to lie about it)

Just for this one. This was not a result of Israel. It was the result of a mistake of a UK journalist taking two separate statements blending into one. There were two separate statements first being they've found decapitated babies/children. And a second separate statement over 30 minutes later claiming they've found over 40 dead children and babies.  These two statements were blended into one statement of 40 beheaded babies which was the lie that swept around the world.
--------------------
--------------------
7 : FalernumComment: You are listing a whole lot of things but let's start with the first: Shireen Abu Akleh

Israel stated they shot near her and Palestinians shot near her, and that they weren't sure who shot her.  This is true!

Palestinian police never made the bullet available to check who shot her.  Israeli internal investigations said it was quite possible they had done so.  The US concluded that Israeli gunfire most likely hit her based on the Israeli investigation.

I don't understand why you say that means Israel lied
 They said they weren't sure and they might have.  They weren't sure.  That's truth
--------------------
--------------------
8 : Delli-paperComment: You can trust them to do and say what benefits them. This is war, after all. Hamas hasn't been light on the propaganda either. Many people still don't believe the Axis of Resistance hides under apartment blocks (Nasrallah) or Hospitals (Sinwar II), or in refugee camps (Dief), despite the fact we have irrefutable proof that they do in the form of leadership having been killed there. 

How do you turn this into good analysis? Whenever Israel (or Hamas) admit something bad has happened to them or makes a comment that hurts them, you can generally take that as the absolute floor. If Israel says the country has lost 62 soldiers in Gaza, then we can safely assume Israel has lost *at least* 62 soldiers in Gaza.
--------------------
--------------------
9 : Commercial_Lead_7406Comment: Some points of accuracy on some of your claims.

40 beheaded babies - No Israeli source ever claimed this. An independent journalist erroneously made this claim early on. The Israelis claimed 40 children killed, some beheaded. Final number of child casualties was around 36, so accurate. It is factually true that at least one child was found decapitated. Others were found dismembered.

&gt;

The Commission reviewed photos of the burnt skull of a decapitated woman found in Kfar Aza. The Commission also reviewed photos of a 12-year-old girl who was shot in the head and then decapitated.

&gt;A first responder, working at a central identification centre for victims of 7 October, told the Commission that containers with “special bodies” were received at the centre. He explained that these bodies included the bodies of children with severed body parts. The centre also reportedly received bags of severed body parts.

[https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session56/a-hrc-56-crp-3.pdf](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session56/a-hrc-56-crp-3.pdf)

The fake Al-Shifa doctor wasn't from official Israeli sources, just some social media poster.

Hamas stealing aid. They do steal aid. Israeli funded gangs do too, but Hamas absolutely steals aid.

The Al-Ahli bombing was falsely reported as 500 casualties from Israeli munitions when in fact actual casualties were unknown, likely far lower, and the munition was likely a PIJ misfire.

[https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/26/gaza-findings-october-17-al-ahli-hospital-explosion](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/26/gaza-findings-october-17-al-ahli-hospital-explosion)

The Gaza MoH has published questionable numbers and has made false statements. The MoH also uses some fairly unreliable methods to report casualties (google docs submissions) and makes no distinction between fighters and civilians. Total numbers are claimed to be broadly accurate, but civilian vs combatant ratios are not well known.

11 : ADP_GodComment: This is not a CMV, but if you are trying to argue that it is somehow less credible than other sources from the war, I would encourage you to look up all the lies that have been told by Hamas up till this point. They're very easy to find if you search. Look at all the casualty counts they walked back, or the fake videos with repeated actors theyve put out, just to name a few. Israel has independant journalism and left wing media.

12 : XolverComment: I'm having problems knowing exactly what bar needs to be met to change your mind, since your post is basically saying you can't trust Israel and then listing a few instances, some of which Israel lied about and some of which Israel decidedly *did not* lie about. Others are trying to tackle your points one by one so I'll try something different.


If the bar is whether Israel never lies or makes mistakes - nope, nothing will change your mind, since it does/has.


If the bar is whether Israel is mostly truthful - it is. If you think otherwise, it would be prudent to say what sort of statistical analysis you performed over Israeli messaging in general that included both truths and lies.


If the bar is whether it's more truthful than Hamas or Palestinians in general... Boy oh boy. This isn't even in the same ball park and I think no amount of evidence could persuade you if you think otherwise. Hamas lies as policy, and any non lie is the exception and not the rule. Many lies are so ridiculously over the top such as saying a leader is just fine for months before admitting he was killed in an attack. I hope you're not deluded enough to think this bar is one Israel doesn't pass.

--------------------
13 : Plus_Bison_7091Comment: Your list conflates rumor, Hamas propaganda, and evolving official narratives; debunking requires nuance, not blanket dismissal.

From the points it’s also unclear to me what you accuse them of lying about. Furthermore, who do you mean by „Israel“ - the government or the IDF because the points that you have given are mostly not based on official statements by any Israeli institution. 

1. Shireen Abu Akleh

Israeli investigations concluded there was “a high possibility” she was accidentally struck by IDF fire aimed at armed suspects. While Al Jazeera found no hostile militants in her vicinity and suggested potential intentional targeting, they are not a reliable source￼. While Israel’s initial denial was misleading, IDF did not lie—they eventually acknowledged IDF fire as likely cause.

2. The “40 beheaded babies”

This narrative originated from unverified Israeli field reports. Most likely a journalist lost in translation when first responders talked about „40 dead children, some of them beheaded“.  Everyone ran with it but Israel never said a thing. 

There is no credible photographic or forensic evidence ever supported claims of infants being beheaded; what was observed were bodies discovered post-mortem with visible trauma, not premeditated beheadings. Which means children were found without a head - we don’t know how they lost it! President Biden’s repeated references were based on these flawed early accounts, not Israel’s official statements, which never confirmed beheading narratives—so the lie is with the rumor, not Israeli officials.

3. The “flour massacre”

Multiple eyewitnesses and U.N. investigators confirmed Israeli troops fired live rounds into crowds seeking aid, resulting in at least 112 deaths—something Israel initially downplayed but later partially conceded￼. BBC and UN reports found large numbers of gunshot wounds consistent with IDF weaponry￼. Israel’s narrative shifted from warning shots to admitting incidents of live fire, showing evolution rather than deliberate falsehood.

4. Al‑Shifa hospital impersonator video

The widely circulated video claiming an “Israeli” nurse inside Al‑Shifa was thoroughly debunked by France 24 and OSINT investigators as staged propaganda. No verified evidence supports allegations of IDF impersonating medical staff. Israel never officially confessed to such an impersonation—it was fabricated by third parties and amplified in partisan media.

5. Al‑Ahli hospital “fake” voice call

The claim alleging staged Israeli propaganda around a doctored Gaza Health Ministry voice call lacks credible evidence. Investigations show fake IDF “confession” posts, not Israeli government admissions. Al‑Ahli’s  incident in Oct 2023 remains disputed but was never supported by Israeli military inauthentic audio.

6. The “15 executed aid workers”

I wanted to summarize [this article](https://steadyhq.com/de/u-m/posts/a90081a0-2186-495b-aa5a-45d6f84e7816) by a German ex-military expert but I think it’s needed to read the full text. It explains well the IDF statements and the events what happened. 

7. Hamas stealing aid (Israeli-funded gang)

There are estimates that about 60 percent of the aid deliveries that went into the Gaza Strip were stolen by Hamas. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of videos—mind you, from Palestinian sources—that show men armed with assault rifles hijacking and driving away trucks. Proudly brandishing their weapons, standing on the cargo. We can debate who these weapon brandishing dudes are - but my bets are on Hamas. 

8. “Pallywood” staged scenes

Claims of staged Palestinian casualties (“Pallywood”) often stem from extreme fringe videos and have been refuted by credible outlets like France 24 and HonestReporting￼. While minor inaccuracies occur in war-zone footage, there is no proof of widespread Israeli-funded fakery. Israel does not retract major events based on such rumors.

9. Gaza Ministry of Health lying

The Gaza Health Ministry, run by Hamas, has a long-documented history of inflating civilian death tolls, including during the 2023 October hospital incident. Independent monitors stress these figures often lack external verification and must be treated cautiously. Israel, for its part, provides its own counts—figures differ, but that doesn’t equate to Israel lying, rather reflects differing data sources.

10. Hamas militants kill count

Israel carefully distinguishes between male civilian deaths and confirmed militant casualties. American and independent intelligence sources challenge high militant death estimates, noting large portions may include non-combatants counted by Hamas-aligned sources. Israel’s claims of militants killed are based on field intelligence and ID cards recovered—complex but not inherently deceptive.

11. Hamas shooting aid‑seekers

IDF-released drone footage shows armed individuals firing at crowds seeking aid in Khan Younis, suggesting Hamas-linked groups have targeted civilians to disrupt aid.

The truth is multifaceted and not an Israeli cover-up.

12. White phosphorus use

Despite accusations, there is no confirmed evidence Israel used white phosphorus in Gaza in 2024–25 from independent war‑crime monitoring groups. Israel denies deploying it, and no credible OSINT or forensic reports verify its use. Until those surface, the claim remains unsubstantiated rumor.

Ugh, I had to write this twice because I had to go back and check my sources. 

In summary, imo the IDF or Israeli government is not deliberately lying. In fact, most times they clearly state that they are “investigating” but sadly they only come out with results far after the rumors are already made facts. Also, in most cases the IDF is able to admit fault. They admitted on October 7, some Israelis (like 4 or something) died by friendly fire (which is from a combat viewpoint completely normal in this chaos) and also they admitted within hours when they shot 3 of the hostages who escaped in Gaza by accident. 

What I recommend you and everyone is to stay open to more information and wait until all sides have their side of the story out to make judgement. 

The IDF is not perfect but there’s a lot of anti Israeli propaganda and fake news out there. Important not to conflate real criticism wirh made up stories.

15 : josh145bComment: This is a Gish Gallop, with too many claims to counter effectively all at once, so let’s take this one step at a time. The Israeli government never spread the 40 beheaded babies thing. When they released an official statement on it, it was to say that it wasn’t true. Biden was a bumbling old man who said a lot of shit.

Also, you have been keeping up with the Israel Palestine conflict since you created your account. The way you say “lately” makes it seem like you are just getting involved.

If you go the Israeli Hebrew-language media, you will see they are even admitting to everything the NYT, Reuters, AP, etc. are denying, and they’re even proud of it.

20 : HiggsFieldgoalComment: I don’t think there’s anything mysterious here.  
  
In a way, it’s sort of poetic with the region being this throwback to the old world, a modern anchor to the crusades and antiquity, that what’s going on is just an old-fashioned strong .vs weak, annexation and genocide to whatever degree is necessary.  
  
History is full of these. Heck, all of North America is basically the result of European colonists just sort of pushing the indigenous people out and taking their land. Sometimes through negotiation, sometimes murder, but push push push until they’re history and the land is yours.  
  
What Israel is doing isn’t anything new. It’s ***old***. It just looks awful while the major powers, having already, for the most part, finished subjugating their indigenous populations, are not “oh so virtuous” now.  
  
That’s basically the flip. When you’re taking over, it’s helpful to demonize the people you’re trying to conquer: barbarians, savages… terrorists. But, once you’ve already setup your borders, then it’s time to get buy in. Now you need to be the good virtuous accepting nice guys.  
  
And Israel is basically just doing 1800s colonization in a 2000s political climate.  
  
Basically, just late to the party. All the modern powers have switched over to the model of feigning high-minded virtue, and merely economically subjugating other nations. That’s actually not new either, really. That’s, for the most part how Rome worked. You don’t have to expand your borders to envelope a nation, just fuck with its government so you can exploit its population without having to make them citizens.  
  
Anyways, that’s all that’s really happening. Rewind just 200 years, and the conflict in that area is as vanilla as they come. How would the Israel/Palestine conflict look ***while*** the United States was still battling the native Americans? Normal as could be.  
  
So, what you have left is just an ancient land grab, but having to be wrapped in modern PR.  
  
It’s sort of a paradox, because it’s definitely putting a square peg into a round hole. What Israel is doing is wholly incompatible with modern sensibilities. But, in Israel’s defense, those sensibilities are mostly hypocritical, only able to be maintained after the subjugation were complete.  
  
If the Native Americans were mounting armed resistance and trying to take back Omaha, I very much doubt people would be terribly empathetic.  
  
Strong conquers weak. That’s it. The rest is PR.

22 : nevergoodisitComment: The main counterpoint is at the bottom of most of the Palestine articles: “According to the Hamas-run health ministry.” The pipeline is this one for news- Hamas sends their stuff to Al Jazeera Arabic, the state media of Qatar (famous for running on imported slavery), then Al Jazeera English translates it into a more digestible form for westerners, and then forwards it to larger media bodies. Their main source is listed as the Gazan Health Ministry, which the large media bodies (correctly) attach to Hamas, which long has been known to run it (as well as UNRWA-Gaza), to avoid legal liability. 

Meanwhile Israeli news is independent of the state, so while you can expect pro-Israel bias, it’s not being actively tampered with or tailored by a government pipeline. Israelis may be suspicious of their own politicians and their own newspapers, as opposed to their politicians themselves, are still more reliable than the Gazan Health Ministry.

24 : ArmThick7835Comment: Not familiar with her name.  
40 beheaded babies was never something that Israel has ever claimed. It literally was just romurs from lifeless Pro-Israelis, though babies HAVE been beheaded  
IDF, unlike your sources, released a statement saying that 10 Palestinians have been close to them in a threatning way so the opened in fire; chaos happened and unfortunately, as like in any war, there were civillian victims; Israel has never denied this.  
Huh?  
It was not fake LMAO, unless your source is Al-Jazeera (banned in both israelk and Palestine btw; Hamas propaganda pull) no source has ever confirmed this is fake  
It was a deadly mistake which happens in every war and the IDF soldiers responsible for that were immediately taken off service (according to both Israeli and Palestinian sources).  
Lol. Hamas stole aid ENDLESS times.

Which lies exactly?  
Gaza Ministry IS full of lies. Hamas is a totalirian regime and therefore every government ministry is directly controlled by them. Multiple times, they have added names for more then 10 times on the same list, recognised Men as Women and Children, didn't spill casualties to terrorists and civillians as in international law (cause theyre a terror group)  
I mean, accordingf to Hamas itself, they lost a HUGE number and are missing people

25 : Mortimer1234Comment: This is war, and with war comes propaganda. For some of these events, you calling them Israeli lies implies that you have chosen to believe Hamas propaganda instead. For example Hamas stealing aid. This is not a lie, and has absolutely been happening. There are videos of Hamas militants shooting people trying to receive aid. There’s a reason why Palestinians have been protesting against Hamas, and many of them have been murdered for doing so. 

“Israel lies” has simply become a convenient slogan for those on the anti-Israel train to shout whenever confronted with “facts” (I use that word lightly, as I don’t think either side is ever going to present unaltered or non-cherry picked information), in the same vain that the MAGA crowd blames the news whenever you point of all of the shit that Trump has done. A key part of propaganda is causing your base to distrust the word of your enemy, which is seen in both sides here. You’re just falling for the Hamas side, in this case

28 : oshaboyComment: I feel like you are mixing up 3 categories in the list. Actual Lies, Unsubstantiated Rumors/Mistakes and "Thing I claim are lies without any proof". 

For example the "40 beheaded babies" claim that you claim "Israel peddled" was likely an unsubstantiated rumor a commander heard from one of his soldiers on October 7th and it was closer to "40 babies killed, some beheaded". It was never actually an official stance. And claiming that Pallywood (or "Palewood") was ever an official IDF stance is absurd. 

The "al-Ahli hospital faked call" is one of those "Things I claim are lies". There is no evidence the call was faked and there is a LOT of evidence that the al-Ahli strike was both a misfire from Gaza and also that the casualty count was quadrupled after the fact. 

The only things of the list you gave where I feel there's actually good evidence that came from an actual lie by the IDF were the killing of Abu-Akleh which was way before the war and the executed aid workers. A lot of these there's sufficient evidence are actually true.
--------------------

29 : s_wipeComment: There are more reliable and less reliable israeli sources.

For example, IDF spokesperson is more reliable than political Israeli figures and influencers.

Their content does get filtered and vetted by a legal team, and the things they publish is considered legal evidence.

So that content is more credible than influencers and politicians who're willing to publish unvetted news that turns out later to be exaggerated .

Unfortunately , vetting news and conducting interrogations into incidents take time.

So when Palestinian media reports a massacre or hospital bombing, it takes a couple of days for the IDF spokesperson to publish their report.

Often, its too late, and a massacre story has been circulating for a while without proper Israeli response.

You need to understand one thing about Israel. They care first and foremost about protecting Jews. That is the nr 1 rule. They where founded on that principle and they enforce it hard to this day.


They don't care how they look. How Palestinians suffer or if you believe them. They feel it as their duty to protect the Jewish people from whatever evils the world can produce(which, granted, looking at the history of Europe is not a very weird development).


They failed in that primary mission in the October attacks and now they're out for blood. They need to eradicate the threats and show the entire world that the Israeli, and Jewish diaspora in general, are off limits.

32 : anarchist_person1Comment: You shouldn’t trust anyone on anything, at least in terms of war. Both Israel and Hamas are underreporting deaths in Gaza, for Hamas mostly because of inability to accurately do it but also possibly to maintain morale somewhat, for Israel to hide the extent of what they have done. Assess any reporting on war critically. I think reporting on war is maybe one area where corroborating reports between multiple news sources isn’t the best guide for if something is real and where instead just logically working out if something is feasible is better suited. On Israel and Palestine, don’t trust the words of either government. Same for Russia Ukraine actually.

There can be organizations and politicians that you chose bot to trust (idf, Netanyahu,  etc. )

They basically have unlimited power and are rarely held accountable no matter what they do or who they hurt. Even when they are held accountable and lose their job over their misconduct, they can just move over to another county, town, etc and become a cop and the fact they got fired from their previous police department might not even come up on their background check. If it did, it probably wouldn't matter. If a cop gets fired for any kind of misconduct such as a wrongful arrest, civil rights violation, police brutality, etc he/she should have their name go on a state wide registry. That way, if he/she were to apply for another cop position within the state their name will pop up as a red flag and no department in the state should be allowed to hire that person. That person would have to move to another state in order to become a cop. It may sound extreme but something like this would make cops think twice before they do something to violate the rights of citizens. 
--------------------
1 : Consistent_Sector_19Comment: Cops who blow the whistle on corrupt departments can end up getting fired for misconduct. It's happened before and it will happen again. There are ways to get around that with state agencies that license law enforcement and can pull licenses for misconduct, but your proposal without modifications wouldn't affect the better departments and it would give the worst of them more power to shut down officers who push back against corruption.
--------------------
--------------------
2 : woailyxComment: You're just gonna get cops who conveniently agreed with their previous department that it was time for them to quit. So either way, you're going to have to depend on the hiring department actually caring about background checks

3 : BigMaraJeff2Comment: Cops get fired all the time. There just isn't a news article about every time
--------------------
--------------------
4 : laidbackeconomistComment: Humans have the capacity for change, so a police officer who was fired for misconduct could become a better person, and there would be no issue with them getting another police job. Just like other criminals who turn their lives around, they should be able to return to their normal life if they are no longer a threat. 

Of course, there needs to be some serious safeguards in place to weed out potential reoffenders, but it shouldn’t be impossible for a police officer to get a second chance.
--------------------
--------------------
5 : MadDingersYoComment: They shouldn't get to be cops anywhere, ever. Period.

6 : Doub13DComment: Define “misconduct”

In most jurisdictions, filing a complaint against an officer is entirely open to the public. Here in Philadelphia, it is as simple as going online and filing a CAP (Complaints against Police) form on the PPD website. 

The unfortunate reality of systems like this are that the overwhelming number of complaints very rarely go anywhere past initial screening. This could be for a wide variety of factors, whether it is incomplete/misremembered information provided by the complainant, officer body camera footage discrediting their claims, false reporting, etc. 

Law enforcement is a profession that will ALWAYS leave a negative perception for people they interact with. I’ve seen victims left traumatized due to being advised against filing charges due to lack of evidence, and I’ve seen perpetrators arrested in front of their own children and family members… these are traumatic experiences that will forever leave a mark on the individuals forced to experience it. 

I’ve personally worked in jobs where anonymous client surveys can 100% lead to termination, and those were just banking jobs. The stress is genuine. 

This isn’t to excuse the attempts made by many departments to protect and cover-up officer misconduct. Complaints, on a cumulative basis, can ABSOLUTELY identify officers in need of more training or a need to be disciplined/removed from the department. 

Last bit, but I think its important to note… the culture of individual departments can vary wildly, and this influences how officers operate on a day-to-day basis. 

To directly address your CMV, I would argue that in many instances, the way departments are run, and the culture that is allowed to develop, are far more impactful than individual actors. An officer moved to another department is going to adapt to the culture of that new department. If misconduct wasn’t tacitly approved of or accepted by leadership, it wouldn’t be tolerated.

If it did, it probably wouldn't matter.

Firstly, you make three assertions here. You say that cops in the US have basically unlimited power and are rarely held accountable; you say that being fired lets them just go to another town and get hired as a cop again without issue; and you say that even if it showed up on a background check, it wouldn't matter. 

What evidence do you have to support these assertions? Because if this is just supposition on your end, then your entire argument becomes very shaky. 

Also, there's this: 

&gt;It may sound extreme but something like this would make cops think twice before they do something to violate the rights of citizens.

I honestly don't believe it would. I don't think that the cops who abuse their power think about possible consequences to themselves, because they believe they're justified. I think that even if this system were in place, it wouldn't stop people abusing their power, because they wouldn't believe they would be held accountable in the first place.

10 : DarthIsopodComment: Look at your state’s CPOST (if you’re a CPOST governed state) and you’ll find loads of officers fired for misconduct who had their certification permanently revoked. 

What you’re describing already is in effect. Misconduct can be anything from violating policy to getting fired for illegal activity. It all gets logged. 

I know a lot of people talk about the hiring process for cops needing to be lengthy, but very few people who talk about it go through it. 

It’s common for the process to take 1-4+ months
--------------------
--------------------
11 : GO_BIRDS150Comment: They have power the constitution grants them. That's not unlimited. 

And if you're going to say that cops rarely get held accountable then you need to show sources. What's the percentage of legitimate violations vs a fitting punishment for the cop that committed it? 

Outside of that I mostly agree. If it's proven that they knowingly and willingly violated someone's rights then strip them off ever becoming law enforcement in any capacity. If it can be shown they were acting in good faith and need retraining then that should be sufficient. It's a case by case thing.
--------------------

12 : ShwowmeowComment: Disagree. Cops shouldn’t be fired for misconduct, they should go to jail, and be blacklisted from ever serving their country in anyway past “cannon fodder” in the third world war.

Resignation while under investigation should be considered an admission of guilt.*


*ETA: Obviously it is already an admission of guilt, but it should be officially considered an admission and treated the same as having been fired.

16 : 14InTheDorsalPeenComment: Police are regulated by a state oversight board, often called POST or something similar.

If they are terminated for misconduct they almost always lose their POST and their access to the NCIC database. Both of those things will prevent someone from working as a police officer.

This includes killing innocent US citizens and it includes clear attacks on our democracy.

I'm only including situations that have a chance of actually arising. If Trump ordered the military to start shooting babies on the street tomorrow, or to round up all Democrats and throw them in jail, I'm sure that the military will resist. The transition to violence will be gradual and there will be enough justification given to give these groups cover for their actions. A few examples of more plausible situations:

1. If situation like the LA protests right now escalates to violence, whether it was started by the police or the protesters, Trump might declare the protesters to be terrorists and tell the military to use lethal force, and the military will comply. He might demand that the police round up the protestors and arrest them, and they will. 

2. If Trump decided that some statement by a political rival was a threat, or provided support for terrorism, and demanded that person's arrest, neither the federal or local police would prevent it.

3. If Trump said that he had evidence that some Democratic victories in 2026 were corrupt in some way, and sent his goons to arrest people involved in certification or whatnot, the police would either help or stand aside. 

I believe this for a few reasons. First, I've just never seen any evidence that it would happen. Second, because there doesn't seem to be an agreed-upon "line that can't be crossed," I suspect that for any given illegal or unethical order, even if some members of the military disagree, most won't speak out, and those that do will be silenced by those above them for whom the order is acceptable. 

What would change my mind:

\- Evidence of any (relatively recent) past resistance among these groups to unlawful or unethical orders. 

\-Any indication that these groups are taking this possibility seriously. Are there plans in place for this situation? Are there whispers of how far would be too far? Is there even popular sentiment that this is a danger?

2 : Cornwallis400Comment: I’ll never say never, but when Trump lost to Biden there were many political leaders (including Pence) who told Trump to get a hold of himself when he wanted to decertify the election.

Likewise, several members of the joint chiefs allegedly told Trumps team to not even think about asking for any kind of intervention around the capitol.

IMO to have the police and military totally lay down you’d need a situation like in Venezuela or Iran, where the generals are literally given millions of dollars a year by the president.

3 : justaguywithadreamComment: The military is made of ordinary Americans that hold all kinds of values and levels of education.


There are absolutely deranged people in the military that would get off and have the best day of their life's if they could open up on LA protesters.


There also people that would put their life on the line to stop it.


The question is who are the majority? Even more so, what are the lower level leaders like platoon sergeants and platoon commanders and company commanders and battalion commanders going to do?


A single person in one of these leaderships positions could affect the actions of a hundred or thousand soldiers. If Pete hegseth ordered protesters to be killed, a company commander could prevent every person in their company from doing anything illegal, or could make all but the very most reluctant (even those that know it is wrong and feel like they shouldn't but follow orders anyways) open fire.


It's not black and white and at the very least there would/will be isolated cases of US soldiers committing atrocities against US citizens. But I think, unless there is a very thorough purge of the military, more leadership than not will do what they can to protect the Constitution and the American people.


I think a brown shirt scenario is much more likely. A few of Hegseth's chronies leading a private army of Nazis and white nationalists and Christians in unmarked uniforms and masks but with enough of a facade of authority that they can commit wide spread murder and spin it to the masses as putting down insurrectionists and violent rioters in the name of law and order. These people are vile idiots, but they understand the importance and how to control the narrative.

6 : YouJustNeuroticComment: &gt;Trump might declare the protesters to be terrorists and tell the military to use lethal force, and the military will comply. He might demand that the police round up the protestors and arrest them, and they will.

These are two very different things. And arresting protestors is legally justifiable depending on their actions. If you throw a Molotov cocktail in a protest as opposed to just randomly in the streets for no reason, those are legally the same action. People make the mistake of believing some sort of narrative force protects them from the law. But my point is its very normal to arrest protestors, it would be very irregular to start massacring them. 

&gt;If Trump decided that some statement by a political rival was a threat, or provided support for terrorism, and demanded that person's arrest, neither the federal or local police would prevent it.

By a statement? Mate I think you're hearing but not listening, things are broadcasted about Trump 24/7 that would make a classical dictator lose his mind. Public figures have called for the death of Trump and Trump didn't do anything about it. You're just not going to get in a lot of trouble for talking in the United States. This is incredibly disconnected from American society and politics.

&gt;If Trump said that he had evidence that some Democratic victories in 2026 were corrupt in some way, and sent his goons to arrest people involved in certification or whatnot, the police would either help or stand aside.

Well this one is certainly true but only because it is completely outside of the police's scope. The police should not arbitrarily decide whether or not the president is lying.
--------------------

7 : noah7233Comment: &gt; and it includes clear attacks on our democracy 

So here's the thing. To make that point. You'd have to admit he hasn't made any clear attack on our democracy. Or admit your view is wrong. 

Because clearly he's in office right now and nobody stopped him. He's issued all of the activities ice is currently doing. And nobody has stopped him. 

So which is it ? Is nothing he's done an attack on the democracy and the people of this country. Or is your point that the police and military ( mind you ice is made up primarily of local police and ex military of any given area ) will disobey and unethical order given to them by him, incorrect?

8 : AlphaWhiskeyOscarComment: I’m in the military. I’m in an aircrew role. Not boots on the ground. I would likely never be in a position to shoot anyone with small arms. I would be up at altitude. So I’m probably not gonna be shooting any babies. But I know the UCMJ, I know what a lawful order is. And more importantly I know how they work.


I’m not entirely sure most people fetishizing these scenarios do.


No enlisted person in any practical situation is deeming an order unlawful. Those are executive decisions. It’s one thing the movie Crimson Tide got right: the XO is actually in a position to relieve the Skipper. When he does, then the junior enlisted jump in and arrest him.


What junior enlisted will absolutely do is report violations up. Anyone of any pay grade is authorized to uphold military regulation. But it’s a Catch 22, because you’re also required by federal law to obey the orders of the officers above you.


If an officer gives you an order that you know violates an instruction (which is ultimately connected to federal law), you report it to a higher officer. Been there, done that. But the point is, somewhere up the chain a higher authority is taking responsibility for the order. You don’t take it in your own hands. You can’t.


In a combat situation, or during a flight in my case, you can protest and make sure everyone knows you’ve protested. But 99 times out of 100 a junior enlisted is going to wait until after the situation to report the violation. This is how people end up at Court Martial for war crimes. It’s just too fucking chaotic to stop in the midst of the situation. It’s a massive risk - not just to yourself, your freedom (you could be the one who ends up in prison), but it’s also a risk that you’re wrong. 


Junior enlisted just don’t have all of the information. Because, again, orders are deemed lawful at an executive level. If you’re told the ROE is satisfied, you’re ready to execute. You aren’t wondering if the COCOM approved it, or if JAG reviewed it. You are in this situation, reality is what you’re told it is, and you are looking at what is right in front of you. A target, a threat, an objective.


If you’re 6 hours in, and suddenly wonder “are we the baddies?” you have a massive cluster fuck situation to deconstruct. What are you going to do? Start shooting your officers? Crash your own aircraft? Fist fight everyone? It just doesn’t even make sense. That isn’t how these things shake out.


Your view is wrong because you think people won’t have the moral fortitude to stop something obviously wrong. It’s built on a flawed premise. Enlisted absolutely will report bullshit. We famously love getting COs fired when they are fucked up. But we aren’t stepping up and arresting them. We’re calling the IG, or the ISIC, or some other higher authority and they sort it out.


Eddie Gallagher was accused by other SEALs, charged and convicted by a jury of other service members. But junior enlisted will use due process, and that usually requires reporting to authorities and allowing the system to take charge. A sudden teary-eyed furious act of ethical courage is movie bullshit. Nobody has that kind of big picture view when shit is hitting the fan.

9 : Outcast129Comment: I did 8 years in the Army, including several in a National Guard Infantry unit including riot activation.

Literally ain't none of that shit happening OP, No offense intended but you (like most redditors to be fair) don't seem to have any grasp on reality when it comes to how the National Guard operates. During the Ferguson Anniversary Riots, my unit literally took fire from rioters at one point and did not even fire back (nor did we want too, at risk of hitting innocent people nearby). The National Guard isn't going to just start shooting at rioters "because Trump said they were terrorists". Also you have literally no idea how our legal system works if you think Trump is just going to start sending out basically Federal hit squads to just round up politicians or activates because Trump said they "threatened" him. Kathy Griffon did a photo shoot *Holding a prop of Trump's Severed Head* and was barely even questioned by the secret service.

I do not like nor did I vote for Trump, but my God the Doomering is exhausting to see constantly every single day. We heard these exact same things the first time Trump was in office, and the man who literally campaigned on arresting Hillary Clinton couldn't even do that, yet suddenly he's gonna be a political evil genius and have every single politican arrested who gives him a hard time? Sure.

The officers in my local precinct are very unhappy with Trump, I haven't asked them if they have any specific plans in place, but I believe that those I know as well as the captain would refuse to unlawfully arrest my Congressman. Then again, I doubt my precinct is representative. It's doubtful a representative sample of America's 1,280,000 sworn law enforcement officers would be possible. I can't tell you that the police in all 50 states will oppose him. I *can* recommend you look into if your local police department or precinct has any community outreach programs.

12 : Diligent_Activity560Comment: That's the kind of thing that could go either way.   Soldiers will generally follow even questionable orders, but I think that if trump orders something particularly egregious at some point there is likely to be a point of critical mass where one senior officer disobeys his order publicly and thousands spontaneously join him.   I guarantee you there are a high percentage of both officers and enlisted personnel who are pondering the details of the oath they swore and trying to determine where they will draw the line.   Military personnel lean conservative, but they are almost universally patriots who hold the constitution in very high regard.  If they turn on trump enmasse it will be over for him.

But in a bit of strategy, if there were massive organized demonstrations taking place across the country I'd start a messaging campaign that the protesters would rather have the military do the crowd control work. Say that they're more professional, less incidents of abuse of power/authority, and that they have a sworn duty to protect its citizens and the constitution.

All of it may not be 100% true but if you build that consistent messaging and keep everything peaceful it could help drive a wedge between all the forces the administration could use to crackdown and violate our 1A rights.

If the situation arise where the order to use deadly force against protesters then the rank and file, junior NCOs and Officers may second guess themselves and disobey those order. Even switch sides in the extreme scenario.

I think the law enforcement know that they're seen as an enemy so they'll act like it so turn the military into a trusted ally or at the very least competent force that embarrasses local PDs.

19 : BoredBrowserAppearedComment: Times in history the military has had to assist the guard in country...

1863: The New York City Draft Riots

1932: Disbanding the "Bonus Army"

1967: Detroit's 12th Street Riot

1967: Newark Riots

1968: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Murdered

1992: Los Angeles Riots

Three things have worked the population up to a degree where the government sent more than the guard most of them race based issues.

But I want one of these to really stand out to people, 1932 the bonus army... This was a name the group used they were to get a dollar a day for their service and that was canceled and they peacefully gathered and protested, the US ARMY was sent in the Veterans thought they were coming in support of them... They were sent to burn them out of town and they did.

For those who think the army can't be used against the citizens take note, for those who think the soldiers will always decline unlawful orders take note, for those who think the army would be willing to turn on friend and neighbor take note, these weren't only friend and neighbor but their fellow veterans, people who had worn their same uniforms but a couple years ago many of them being injured while in uniform, just to be injured by the same uniform a couple years later for no more than asking for what they were promised by the government they served.

20 : daneg-778Comment: The problem with your theory is that this "gradual" process must be carefully guided, or it will backfire. Trump's administration is incapable of carefulness (or any competence) that is necessary. They'd rather give an order to kill babies now than wait another half a year to build a "pretext" for some violent action. And even if they play this five-dimensional chess then any number of random events will happen and topple their plans. Authoritarian regimes lack flexibility that is required in this modern world of change. The sad thing is that many Americans will be hurt, even if heritage foundation's master plan does not work.

21 : Smooth_ValueComment: You may be right. There are approximately 2 million active-duty personnel in the US armed forces and federal government. The next county next to me, has over 22 million guns. Also, 400 million with citizens. 70M voters for Trump, but not MAGA enough. Hi-tech armies don't do you any good, do they? The Military knows this; their recruitment is at rock bottom, and the people they get are not exactly mean, lean, and fit machines. At this Point, Elon would probably hire the biggest mercenary army and participate as 3rd party—the most enormous math maths. There is no military takeover option.

Plus there are about 100-200 people at every single step of obeying an order that high. And then there are 100-200 more people who each individually can prevent anything like that happening.

The narrative that America (or as some agitators like to call, the "aMeRiCaN EmPiRe") is "collapsing" or "dying" has been floating around for a few years now, mostly in polarized social media spaces detached from reality, and mostly in response to the rise of Trump, the greater conservative populist movement, and political polarity. At first, I just found it annoying because I don't think doom and gloom helps anyone who isn't trying to gain from the message, and that hope is always a better avenue. But I have now come to the belief that the idea isn't just annoying, it's historically blatantly untrue and will remain untrue. Still, I want to know why my reasoning might not hold true, and not just "can't predict the future!"

My reasoning stems from the idea that this country has made it through *WAY* worse than anything we've seen in the last decade. The saying may be cliche, but I genuinely stand by it when viewing history, both domestically and abroad. America signed the Dec. of Independence in 1776, and was able to begin operating as its own country after the revolutionary war in 1783, so I'm going to be viewing from that year on afterwards.

**I'll begin by looking domestically**. These are the 3 biggest events in my opinion that our nation went through which genuinely had true and full potential to end the country as people knew it:

1. The War of 1812. The British Empire trying to regain what they had lost is genuinely horrifying if you think about it. Imagine gaining independence only to have to fight off the very same oppressive totalitarian aggressor *again* just to keep it. That doesn't usually happen in history, where instead one of 3 things normally happen: conquered territory is never relinquished and forever altered, territory is never conquered, or territory is conquered, but then freed from that specific aggressor forever. We had to engage the very same aggressor, as if Britain could not fathom the idea that it did not have a right to our nation. I feel like the War of 1812 isn't talked about enough because it's the only war since our Revolution where America, as a whole, had to fight another nation not for its benefit or revenge, but for its total survival. But we did it and made it through.
2. Confederacy and Civil War. Self explanatory; country actually did split and resulted in the deadliest war in American history by American casualties because it was Americans fighting Americans. Civil wars normally end in either one side's victory, or permanent fraction. We came out with the former and moved on.
3. Great Depression. America had become one with its industry and industry economy at this point, so what the Great Depression had the potential to do was basically never let us come back. But we came back and moved on (love you FDR).

Before I continue, there were two other events I considered but decided against, and I want to address:

* Chattel slavery. It was horrific and the poster child of the humans rights abuses this country was physically founded upon (in conjunction with native genocide), and we must continue to learn from history. However, for this post, I must look at numbers: since 1783, African Americans, slaves or free, were never majority of the people in the nation's entirety (not talking about specific states where they actually were at some points). At its peak in 1860, slavery accounted for 4M people, with the total population being around 31.5M. Today, AA's make up 13% of the population. In my opinion, while slavery anywhere is a great argument for QOL and human/civil rights measures, you can't determine the future health/continuation of a nation based on the ill of a genuine numerical minority.
* COVID. Obviously a terrible disaster and may all those affected find health and peace. But when viewing numbers, it took a greater toll on well being and emotional health than it did actual stability. Numbers wise, population was barely scratched (around 1.2M out of around 330M). And while the economy clearly tanked and we will be facing countless problems (mostly mental) in the future because of COVID, we came out pretty well given this was the modern day plague and the world began by having 0 counter. The lockdowns sucked and in 1929, they might have ended us. But this time we had technology and it was honestly that which saved our economy from total collapse like what happened in the GD, and also the reason why despite the economy tanking overall, unlike the GD, there were economic increases in many distinct places too (ex: Zoom).

Since the GD, almost everything America has been involved with regarding our health as a nation has been domestic civil political unrest and conflicts abroad, so ones not on American soil, and thus not ones that really threatened the nation's people's lives and thus the nation's continuation. Cold War was terrifying yes, but it didn't amount to shit. Worst artificial attacks against explicitly American li

Every problem that was faced in history never had this weapon that has gerrymandered the whole world, hell even gerrymandered an individual. It is an unprecedented time where there are multiple visible pressure points that are being simultaneously pressed with the effect of social media on individual voters. Democracy has not been used to destroy itself at this rate at any point in history.

I'll leave others to change your view, but just a side-note, this is a somewhat wild take on 1812. The US declared war on Britain, not the other way around, and in no small part because the British were arming indigenous groups resisting American colonial expansion. While history is somewhat ambiguous the rhetoric of America's annexation of what would become Canada was pretty central. The UK was extremely busy fighting Napoleon at the time, most notably in Spain - there was not a serious attempt to "retake" America.

Also, I have to tell you, Britain at the time was not a totalitarian state. The British monarchs by this point were largely figureheads - not quite as much as they are today, but by and large they were heavily subordinate to Parliament. They were certainly not the autocratic "Enlightened despots" of, say, Russia (or France, for that matter). This had been true since the late 17th century. Britain was hardly a full-blown democracy yet, but then again, neither was the US, given that the right to vote was confined by law to property-owning white men. That doesn't mean that the American colonies were given adequate political representation or that the War of Independence was necessarily unjustified or something but the idea that the Americans were freedom-loving democracy-havers and the British lived under the thumb of an oppressive totalitarian state is not a particularly fair characterization.

America controls territories without allowing them to speak for themselves on their controlling government level, see Guam and PR.

American spread West in the US with no regard to the people’s in place before them and as evidenced by the States itself existing on overthrown nations land.

The monarchy of Hawaii was overthrown with US financial support.

11 : FlashMcSuaveComment: There is a good, long read here which I think is much more relevant to your central question (will America collapse?) and it relates to a topic that you didn't even touch on at all. 

https://aeon.co/essays/history-tells-us-where-the-wealth-gap-leads

The central thesis is that you can go back through history and find a common thread for empires that *did* collapse. 

Economic inequality gives rise to an entrenched aristocracy and widespread disillusionment among the general public who no longer feel invested in the success of that society. Then you often get elites infighting among each other, tearing much of the society apart. 

American economic strength post WW2 came about from being the sole superpower left standing with intact manufacturing and economic base, and given that a large chunk of the productive European workforce was young males killed en-masse, elite capitalist classes had to actually pay labor well. Globally and particularly in America.

This resulted in a booming middle class, who in turn powered the economy as consumers. 

That middle class is now being hollowed out. 

American socioeconomic mobility is quite poor by global standards. 

https://www.weforum.org/stories/2020/09/social-mobility-upwards-decline-usa-us-america-economics/

Economic inequality is rising:

https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/

A big part of this is lower and lower wages for all but a select few professions, and many of those in the most well developed cities only. 

AI also has the potential to make this worse, resulting in higher levels of unemployed. America in particular has very little by way of a safety net compared to other western democracies so it may be even worse for Americans. 

You need to engage with this core issue. The things you discuss in your original post are symptoms, not causes of this.

12 : Its_Lamp_TimeComment: Mostly agree but I do have a bone to pick with the characterization of the Nixon administration. Especially his first term was pretty good. He largely continued the Great Society programs of LBJ’s administration and created the EPA. He also discontinued the draft and then got us out of Vietnam. He was from a better time when both parties worked together more than they do today and Watergate killed his viability completely. Today, Watergate would not be as earth-shattering as it was back then. Honestly if the Watergate scandal had not happened I believe he would be remembered by both sides as one of the best Presidents we’ve had. He’s definitely up there in my mind despite having some serious skeletons in his closet.

13 : BaylinerVR5Comment: The riots are the symptom not the cause. A country doesn’t generally collapse because of riots, but riots usually signify a serious underlying issue.

Fact of the matter is that we’re reaching unsustainable levels of debt, unprecedented political polarisation, and we live under an administration that has permanently shifted the nature of politics, and is breaking every norm. Salaries are stagnant, people are increasingly struggling to get by, and many people feel pessimistic about the future. 

We’re in a post-truth information environment that is getting more extreme with every election. 

All of this is at a time where our main governing system is gridlocked and unable to meaningfully function. All the infrastructure around us was built by people that preceded us by two generations. Not only have we not innovated on it and laid the groundwork for future generations, we’re failing at maintaining it. Isn’t it objectively shocking that we haven’t been able to build a single line of high speed rail? We have a wholly incompetent government at all levels that is detached from reality. From local governance all the way to the highest offices. Our schools are being defunded, we’re struggling to get anything done, and we’re constantly moving towards conflict. Be it getting dragged into a war with Iran by Israel and her elected US sycophants or a face off with China. This is also in a time where our relative global standing is decreasing with the rise of Asia.

Are the LA riots going to collapse the country? No. Is it a sign of a coming collapse? I think so. P

Physically (most cities levelled, every now and then thousands have to be evacuated because they keep finden WW2 bombs in construction sites), politically, geographically, and culturally. Germany was occupied after WW2. Without the Marshall Plan, it would probably still be an irrelevant nation.

Simply looking at the current situation in the US from a historical perspective, there are, in fact, some similarities regarding the rise of the Nazis and MAGA. That does not mean, at all, that this is bound to be the US's fate. Just that your example is poorly chosen for the bigger point you are trying to make.

16 : rangdaComment: The main predictor for violent revolution is the size of the gulf between the ruling class and the working class and economic despair of the latter.   
       
Since time immemorial across the whole world this has been the universal powder keg waiting for a spark.    
          
The US has had a strong middle class for generations now, with very healthy upward mobility between the classes. When this existed, civil unrest was low (excluding temporary swells re: issues like the civil rights movement and Vietnam conscriptions). 
 But since the 70s this middle class has been shrinking, fast.   
        
As a ruling class (the class with disproportionate influence over policy, ie rich people) is able to take more and more and the potential for the working class to own their own assets and gain security from those assets shrinks and shrinks, a vicious cycle (a spiral) occurs where the rich can get richer faster, a the poor get poorer faster and it accelerates year over year. 
Look up a chart showing median wages vs housing prices. That is what you are looking at now. 
                
Rather than a working, a middle, and a wealthy class, you end up with a only a ruling class and a **serf** class - workers with almost no autonomy, no land of their own, no labour unions or bargaining power. No upward mobility, no dreams.  
Working only to survive, while others reap virtually all of the reward. 
      
Look at housing - only a single generation ago, buying a home was the norm for families with two working parents. Now, it’s shooting further and further out of reach even outside most urban centres.  
            
What does this do? How does it contribute to a spiral of volatility?  
      
Once one generation of a family is squeezed out of property ownership, one set of parents is bled for rent until they die. The knock-on effect is their children have nothing to inherit: often an inheritance would be the only way a renting person could afford a deposit. So that’s another generation of lifelong renters. 
        
The more property someone owns, the more they make from their renters and the more property they can buy.   
They are no longer competing with families trying to buy a single home, they’re competing with other mega landlords who earn more and more each year from their tenants. 
That is happening now. Today. 
      
The same way small businesses are bought out by larger ones, the pool of small business owners shrinks and like with rent money, all that hard earned cash flows uphill like a massive pyramid scheme to a shrinking pool of owners and shareholders. 
       
It is a spiral of endless greed which eventually has to reach a breaking point.         

The US American is an individualist who puts an emphasis on fair treatment and opportunities. He or she can only go for so long accepting what is becoming more and more apparent as unfair treatment and a shrinking potential for opportunity. 
The US American person is no longer easily placated by so-called “bread and circuses” distraction, or the nice man on the news telling them everything is normal. They have social media now.  
        
Americans know what the term *Oligarch* means who had never heard that word before a decade ago.     
              
They know what percentage of wealth is owned or controlled by an astonishingly small percentage of people and families, when their parents’ generation had no idea at all about any of that.  
          
They have begun to recognise that the two party partisan system means their vote only offers a narrow range of choices which can not effectively or significantly change the prospects for the working man or woman. 
       
Post-slavery (when the single most valuable asset in the country was paperwork for the ownership of human beings), this is a unique and quite a rapidly accelerating issue.   
Even in the Great Depression wealth inequality wasn’t as severe as it is today. 

You’ve claimed that it’s not realistic for the US to fall, to implode, because it’s not facing anything it hasn’t faced before is not true.
Wealth inequality is that issue.

17 : arme_poolComment: Nobody sane is expecting US to collapse anytime soon. What will happen is US losing its soft power in the world to China and slowly but steadily losing it's world power status. US is really close to lose western Europe as ally. Not one year from it but Europe now realized that we need to be able to self defense. When we will we won't go along with US blackmailing us for example into not condemning Israel. 
What signal you think is for example European countries starting to call Israel on what they are? Why do you think it didn't started earlier? We didn't wanted to lose US support. Now we just know that we don't have it either way so we can stand stronger to our values (respect for human rights).

18 : moderatelymeticulousComment: The collapse of the United States is not going to be like any of the things you’ve described.

We aren’t going to fail because of political unrest or because we get attacked by some other country. We’re going to fail because industrialized capitalism is unsustainable.  We might run out of resources first. Or we might run out of people to do the jobs. But what most likely is, we’re going to run out of runway due to climate change. Oh, we’re gonna be unable to handle the ex pandemic because we’re too profit driven. Or all the micro plastics on our blood are going to catch up to us. Or the Rising national debt is going to bankrupt the government which will strangle trade domestically and abroad so much that will see tens of millions die.

When these things happen, they’re gonna happen to other countries, including the United States at around the same time, so this may not fit your view exactly. But I think we are going to see systemic collapse because we can’t just keep growing on a planet of finite size. Eventually, it’s going to run out. Nobody knows when, but eventually it’s gonna happen.

Democracy is not the key to determining whether the United States will survive. In fact, nothing can determine the survival of a country.

When destiny comes, the United States will be number one in the world.

When destiny goes, the United States will decline.

This is quite normal. China is not a religious country, so why does it believe in the Mandate of Heaven? This is not without reason.

Take the Qing Dynasty as an example. The Qing Dynasty was not democratic, it faced foreign invasions and civil wars, but it managed to survive wave after wave of crises.

The Qing Dynasty began industrialisation and implemented a constitutional monarchy, which was undoubtedly better than absolute monarchy.

Do you know what? The Qing Dynasty perished because of the constitutional monarchy.

20 : Good-Ad-9156Comment: I know this wasn’t written by AI because only a human would be that wrong about the cause of the war of 1812. Yes the British forced American sailors into service of the British navy, and that’s not cool. But the war was really about trade, territorial expansion into Canada (failed), and fear of future conflicts with Britain. 

It was America that believed they had a right to British territory (Canada) and not the other way around. Burning down the whitehouse was just a fuck you for invading. There was no earnest attempt to retake America.

21 : Queasy_Artist6891Comment: Yeah, it survived these disasters you just mentioned. But would America have survived a Civil War during the great depression? Because that's where things are headed. Europe and Canada no longer trust the US as an ally, the tariff nonsense meant prices reached an all time high, and Trump is going after the thing that made America a powerhouse to begin with; namely its universities and its immigration policy to bring talented people to the country. Even if it doesn't collapse, it will no longer be the superpower it has been in the past.

22 : odean14Comment: That was a long read... However point are taken. I think the collapse of the United States will come when it decides to be a divided states. This division will come about when the political duct tape of representative democracy, greed and ignorance reach their peak. 

Right now, croney capitalism, digital feudalism and money hording are the main issues. And right now, the only reason the country hasn't erupted yet is because these pillars that it currently stand on is maintained by ignorance, greed and the ideal of settling. Simply put the average citizen is fine as long as they get to be entertained, eat, have sex, keep up with the Jones and leaving all their thinking to the one party system made up of democrats and Republicans. 

I think the day will come when corporations get the right to vote. When these corporations have complete control of the country and creates a neo feudalistic economy, that is when the collapse will start. When the middle class is dead, and safety nets are taken away via privatization and the means to profit from it fails via a massive crash. The Globe will lose trust in the USD. Then that's it. The majority of states will see a dead USD and want a fresh start as country. Some states will not want the want their economy associated with a dead USD. The constitution will be amended and allow for states to leave the union. The military assets will be divided amongst states. And new country coalitions or blocks will form. There won't be a civil war. The people will just go with it and let it happen because at the end of the day, full belly, sex, entertainment and no critical thinking is what the average citizen pursue. Plus, we tend to vote against our own interests, via a single issue voter mindset and party loyalty mindset.

23 : KeySpecialist9139Comment: Your argument that America is unlikely to collapse is well-reasoned and historically grounded, but let’s engage with it critically focusing primarily on the US foreign debt and fiscal sustainability, combined with constitutional crisis. 

You rpoint out that the US has endured existential crises and emerged stronger. 

However, both national debt and constitutional crises are structural threats, unlike acute crises (wars or depressions). 

Supply chain disruptions from high tariffs and loss of appetite for U.S. Treasuries, when combined with Trump’s authoritarian tendencies and the US debt crisis, could accelerate instability, leading to a tipping point where the US faces severe economic and social disruption.

Maybe not "Mad Max" collapse, but a Brazil or Argentina-style decline is certainly very possible.

24 : vescisComment: There is a vast difference between the stated premise 'America will not collapse' and the summary 'will be fine lol'

Will it collapse in the near future? Probably not - there is a lot of inertia and no end of distraction available. There is significant chance of violence as ICE escalates - starting to see it in LA. If the President TACOS again that will die down, but the deportations seem be their main current goal and we can easily see more of that in NY, Chicago etc. Having the army routinely deployed on civilians doesn't immediately collapse the country but it very much not 'fine lol' 

A civil war like our previous one is unlikely as the geographic boundaries are a lot less easily divisible and economic interdependence is a lot higher. But a lot of everyday violence by and against national guard, ICE, law enforcement? That's a death spiral, though potentially a really long one. 

There is also a decent change of a massive election dispute, real or manufactured, in 2028. Either 45 runs again with flimsy justification, or there is massive voting restriction around Real ID/ name changes/etc,    objective truth has taken massive damage, so it will be nearly impossible for most to know what to believe. Maybe someone eventually concedes to move on, but each time this happens it becomes less likely it will happen again - not immediate collapse but slow death spiral

Finally, at some point the trade war and the loss of domestic farm workers really hits home. There will be significant food shortages in the near to mid future given current direction. We are deporting people that pick the crops, and global trade routes are being rearranged to include a lot less US. At best this leads to inflation/ rationing, at worst, riots. Might even hit in the next administration, or they won't be able to fix it quickly, which will erode confidence further in government. Slow death spiral. 

Rome collapsed in a few pages on our history books.  It took hundreds of years real time.  Empires and countries die slowly. We keep adding nails to the coffin

25 : Existing_Western_423Comment: I'm sorry but you simplified what happened in Germany after WW2. The country was literally totally defeated, fully occupied and there was a whole process of denazification, demilitarization, democratisation and decentralisation. Also literally split in half and didn't unify for decades. And God knows what the fuck would this century look like if there was not a whole process of european integration and massive aid by the US to Western Europe. Also if core German territories exist, where is Prussia? You know, the entity that united Germany and which wad ruled by the dynasty of future German Emperors? You know that the Polish border was moved west into Germany? Even before WW2, The Polish got the Gdansk corridor...

Secondly, collapse, in general, doesn't have to happen with the snap of a finger. Rome fell in the span of hundreds of years with the fall of Constantinople being the definitive end. And collapse of an empire doesn't mean the nation or state dissapears. The Austrian empire collapsed, yet Austria still exists. The Spanish aren't a major player or a world power with a colonial empire, yet they still exist. Russia lost a lot of territory in Central Asia, Eastern Europe and the Caucases, yet is still exists. 

But yes, I agree that the internet is too doomer. What I think will happen is that the US will go back to "muh neutrality" until another event similar to Pearl Harbor, 9/11 or a new type of threat emerges. The main problem facing the US is the crazy polarization and this weird idea that everything will be okay, because we went through worse. As if the future is not the most unpredictable thing ever.

One single moron aggressively pissing off every other nation on the planet may not be enough to destroy our economy, but our national debt will become a problem (like every other country’s would) in the event that the rest of the world’s financial systems drifted away from being anchored on ours (i.e. if dim-witted conservatives continue to be elected).

The founders envisioned the states as independent entities, tied together in an alliance, something like the European Union.

American hegemony is something that is so baked into our world view that we have no idea how much protection and comfort it provides us. And how recently it was established. Really just since world war 2. Prior to that, America was a fortress thanks to our geography and relative self sufficiency. We want stuff from other nations, but didn’t actually need stuff from them. That’s no longer the case. We are vulnerable to attacks within our borders, or from the air, or from cyberattacks.

I think the current administration is a unique threat because our sense of rule of law was the biggest thing we had. People wanted to do business here because of the stable law and courts system. They wanted to do business because of the relative lack of corruption. Now? We are a gamble. I think America will survive, and our geographic isolation means it’s unlikely someone is going to come occupy us, but we will no longer be the center of the world economy. Other countries will treat us with wariness, a rogue state, and plan accordingly.

Wounds last.  My kids are just starting out...what will this end up doing for them for their whole lives?  Countries have gone from democracy to dictatorship while keeping the same name...and stayed there for decades. Whose to say it can't happen here?

35 : Definitely_Not_BotsComment: I appreciate your methodical approach but I believe your premise is misguided.

You state you are arguing against the claim "America will collapse" but your examples are about the complete turnover of countries (like civil war or independence), whereas the folks who believe "America will collapse" are viewing it more like the collapse of the USSR or imperial Japan.

Obviously Russia and Japan are still here, but the governments that existed at the time are completely rebuilt. Nobody is claiming that the United States will somehow lose its borders or its cities - they are saying that the American system as we know it (politically, perhaps economically as well) is collapsing *from* democracy (or "democratic republic" if you're a pedant) *into* fascism (or something fascist-adjacent).

36 : thecoat9Comment: I think you need to consider the average life span of democracies of any form, we are past our expiration date in that regard.  I'd also look into the history of fiat currency for a likely root catalyst of national collapse.  I in no way want to see the nation collapse, and your various examples point to the strength of the nation to be sure, but there is no guarantee of perpetuity for any nation.  We can survive thousands of adverse events and it still only takes one that we don't survive to be the end.  If you look at the history of nation state collapse it's not a strait downward path to destruction.  With the benefit of hindsight you see similar often repeated patterns and even as a state heads toward collapse there are periods of relief and optimism.

Sometimes safety mechanisms don't work the way they are supposed to. 
And America is very much not ok, every time I'm back in the country people are more insane, more stressed, and more generally nuts.
There is no reason for it

--------------------
38 : airplane3579Comment: You do rightfully point out that America has gone through worse and survived events like the great depression, though I would like to counterargue given current conditions we're facing.

What America is facing now is not “just another crisis”, it's the terminal crisis of its entire economic model, and history shows that modes of production do collapse when their contradictions can no longer be contained. You argue that America won’t collapse because it's survived past crises like the Civil War, Great Depression, and political unrest. But I’d challenge that framing: those were crises within a relatively stable industrialized or pre-financialized capitalist model. What we face now is a collapse of that model itself. Over the last few decades, the U.S. has shifted from a production-based economy to one dominated by financialization, where speculative capital, debt-leveraged assets, and monopolized rent extraction have replaced real growth. This is not a temporary detour but the logical end-stage of capitalism, as Lenin described in *Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism.* The private equity model for example, doesn’t grow companies, it cannibalizes them through leveraged buyouts and debt extraction like we saw with Sears, Toys ‘R’ Us and Red Lobster, which creates systemic risk in the process.

You mention past depressions, but unlike the 1930s, today’s economy is built on a fragile foundation of fictitious capital, artificially low rates, and historically unsustainable sovereign debt. The Federal Reserve’s repeated bailouts and QE cycles since 2008 haven’t resolved underlying issues, they’ve merely inflated asset bubbles that grow more dangerous with each round. Now, with debt-to-GDP exceeding 120%, rising long-term Treasury yields, and mounting defaults in commercial real estate and corporate debt, we’re facing not a typical downturn but a structural unraveling.

If Treasury auctions begin to fail, with no-bid scenarios or mass foreign divestment, the Fed may be forced to intervene and buy Treasuries on the secondary market, injecting massive liquidity to stabilize prices. But this would likely accelerate dollar devaluation and inflation expectations, especially if global confidence erodes. Meanwhile, interest payments on the debt are exceeding $1 trillion annually. If the U.S. enters a “borrow-to-pay-interest” loop while political paralysis stalls fiscal response, like during a debt ceiling standoff, or broader feedback loops start to accelerate, it risks triggering a sovereign debt crisis and a liquidity collapse. At that point, monetizing debt becomes the only politically feasible path, setting the stage for a hyperinflationary spiral through forced systemic responses to collapsing confidence in public debt and currency.

We see that capital no longer invests in productive infrastructure (i.e. the CA high-speed rail that is gridlocked for profit-based reasons).

Tariffs aimed at restoring domestic industry only raise costs and provoke retaliation, they remove access to cheap labor, which had delayed capitalism’s collapse. Additionally, Quantatative Easing and ballooned federal reserve asset sheets have become a permanent thing and makes the system dependent on larger and larger injections, with diminishing returns and growing inflationary risk.


You compare today’s instability to WWII or the Civil War, but those were external shocks or intra-systemic conflicts. What we're witnessing today is the implosion of capitalism’s ability to reproduce itself and to generate surplus value, reinvest, and maintain legitimacy. That’s a qualitative difference, not just a new iteration of the same historical cycle.

Collapse doesn’t mean a sudden explosion, it means an accelerating erosion of state legitimacy, economic viability, and social cohesion. And that is happening now: record inequality, asset bubbles, stagnating wages, mounting debt, and the replacement of labor by machines or rent-extraction mechanisms. These aren’t temporary trends, they are expressions of capitalism’s terminal contradictions.


So, to respond to your TL;DR. I don’t believe America will collapse overnight. But I do believe we’re witnessing the slow-motion collapse of the American capitalist order, and without radical transformation, that collapse could become irreversible, not because of “doom and gloom” pessimism, but because the material conditions no longer support the system’s survival.

39 : Weekly_Ad_3665Comment: I mean sure, we’ve “endured” conflicts that seem bigger than stuff going on now, if they happened today, stakes would be much higher. To put it simply, Americans in the early-to-mid 19th century didn’t dominate the planet in economics or political/military force; they were just another country. So they wouldn’t have to worry about the consequences of such conflicts or unrest. 

If a second Civil War or Great Depression were to occur, the United States would suffer far worse consequences than we had to experience hundreds of years ago simply because we’ve become too important to the rest of the world.

40 : FfdmattComment: I like your example with Germany as a country that fell and even lost a major war that could recover. It makes sense. 


My concern is *how* we have our power and status at the moment. It rests upon things like our currency being used as a reserve and the rest of the world tolerating our presence militarily and otherwise all over the world. 


The margins that provides us have given us a hell of a life. If that collapses, we'll definitely survive as a country, but I don't think any of us are prepared for the change in quality of life that will come and likely remain in that scenario. 
--------------------
--------------------
41 : ThelodiousComment: Yes we will here's why. Our economy is incredibly insustainable for a lot of reasons. One of the main ones I really think about is just the fact that our currency is really way too valuable. Our country is so wealthy that even cashiers and other bottom wrong workers pay for cars and use those cars to get to work. That's kind of crazy when you think about it, that they can afford that pray the trouble is that increasingly, they can't. There are parts of the country where those cashiers could get to work by bicycle or public transit in vast swaths of America a car is the only viable way for a lot of these bottom line workers to get to work. 

And here in lies the problem. The global economy is gradually dedollarizing. Which means that America is gradually going to need to transition to importing as much as we export. The whole bubble economy running on the dollar is the only reason we were ever able to import so much more than we export. What do you think will happen to our economy once we can only import as much as we export. You can no longer take out more and more deaths to maintain this BS? One sweet become just another country that can only engage in trade in a fair equal manner? 

What's going to happen is, cashier's warehouse workers and other low wage workers will no longer be able to afford cars. Which means they won't be able to get to work. Which could lead our entire economy to collapse. We Built a massively wasteful car centric society. Housing and everything about our society are so ridiculously spaced out that we couldn't transition to public transit even if we wanted to because everything's just too spread out for that sort of system to be viable. The only way we could possibly transition to a transportation system built around public transit and bicycles as if vast swaths of our sprawling housing is abandoned. And eventually when the average American becomes too poor to afford a car, this is inevitably what we will have to do. And now that Trump is accelerating this whole de dollarization process, he's just accelerating the point at which this will happen.

 Means that lots of people's $300,000 homes will eventually become worthless. Not just because the average American will inevitably become too poor to afford a car of this but also because our infrastructure is crumbling and in a lot of towns the only way they could possibly replace their crumbling infrastructure is if the institute a property tax rate of 100%, which is impossible. Those sprawled towns are doomed. 

As these problems kick in they're going to pile on to all the other horrific problems are facing like our debt crisis that's evolving into a debt doom spiral into a bankruptcy if the federal government. The only way to fix the debt crisis is the tax to Rich not only by upholding existing tax codes but passing new taxes on the rich. Good luck politically achieving that. This means that if business as usual is maintained the government will eventually go bankrupt which will take all these problems I've mentioned and multiply them exponentially. 

You can't even keep the cork on this bottle with authoritarian repression because Americans are the most well-armed civilian population on the planet. There's only so much of a reduction in our average quality of life that we will accept before it leads to a degree of violent unrest that collapses the whole goddamn thing. 

And I haven't even mentioned the growing threats we're facing from environmental pollution and climate change. Our Southwest is turning into an uninhabitable desert and that uninhabitable desert will gradually grow and spread further and further creating a massive refugee crisis gradually over the coming decades and likely continue to get worse for at least the next few centuries.

Every single existential threat we are facing, we fundamentally lack the political will to properly address any of them.  every time our government faces one of these challenges they have some cells One question. How can we help our corporate overlords get rich off of this? If they can't then they generally do nothing, just kick the can down the road. Trouble is, we are running out of road.

45 : Intelligent-Boss7344Comment: The biggest threat to America today is not division, Trump, corruption, or the Supreme Court. Most of those things you list are symptoms of a much deeper problem which is the death of a thing called the American Civic Religion. Which I would define as the belief that America is unique and important because it was founded as a democratic country with individual liberty and built in mechanisms to root out injustice.

That’s not to say we are perfect, but it was a belief that we have a Civic Duty to leave our country in better shape than we found it in. It was an optimistic belief that there is hope. This set of beliefs and values is what got America through some of the worst situations we have ever faced. Every President from Washington, Lincoln, FDR, JFK, and Reagan espoused this set of beliefs. It was a core principle of both parties for generations.

The biggest problem with American politics today is that this set of virtues has been dead in both parties for a while now. Conservatives have gone from talking about America as the greatest country on Earth to saying that America is a banana republic/third world shit hole/communist country. Many liberals now believe America is irredeemably evil and oppressive because of it’s past, that it is an exceptionally evil country, and that the world would be better off without our presence.

Politicians of either party sound less and less hopeful. Populism and conspiracy culture is dominating the political conversation on both sides of the aisle. I am not a complete cynic who believes we are destined to die, but if we do not try to revive the singular set of values and beliefs that carried us through all of those crises you mention, we will never come out of then stronger like previous generations did.

46 : mikiencolorComment: I think you're quite mistaken. If the present instability in the US could be summed up as simply the popularity of Trump, then I would agree. The rise of Trump, however, is not the disease, it's a symptom of the disease - a rot that has been festering for decades and already exploded before in the Great Recession.

The US has a republican system of government. Such a system depends on sober stewardship from an electorate capable of managing their country's affairs competently, or at least one intelligent enough to delegate that responsibility to competent agents. It has entered into a global information age with this system.

The US electorate is simply not collectively intelligent enough to properly run the country. This contradicts the viability of the very republican system on which the US is established.

The complexity of modern society is well beyond the ken of the average American voter. The cause of the Great Recession was literally this stupidity. Financial instruments had become so complicated that the people selling them no longer understood them, and were thus incapable of managing them responsibly. The US government is in exactly the same predicament - the modern US is such a large and complicated beast, dependent on the functioning of so many interdependent pieces, that its electorate no longer understands how it works or what it needs, and is thus incapable of managing it responsibly.

In the past this intellectual deficit was fudged. Information was mainly provided through newspapers or television outlets, which only the most erudite actually found engaging. The people who had trouble understanding the world or their country simply did not participate in politics. Now, however, the Internet has opened people to direct engagement by ideologues, influencers and foreign adversaries who want to take advantage of their stupidity to attack the very foundations of the US.

Look at how Musk describes people's fads - "mind virus". He recently described ignorant MAGA opposition to solar energy in these unflattering terms. And he's not wrong.

But what does "mind virus" imply? That the electorate's thoughts on such matters are not their own. That they do not seek factual technical information to determine the viability of something like solar power.

It implies that the electorate's thoughts are nothing more than a contagion. A more clever individual than they are - an influencer or foreign social analyst or demagogue - has assessed their biases, and crafted some very simple and effective memes that confirm those biases. They are then manipulated into a tribe, the identity of which is determined by adherence to some rudimentary ideas.

Voters are nothing more than carriers of other people's "mind virii'. Thus, you're never actually engaging with the American electorate. You're engaging with Vladimir Putin, Steve Bannon, Judith Butler, or Elon Musk himself. They are fighting each other \*through\* the American electorate, because enough of the electorate is incapable of critical and independent thought that they are nothing more than a mental battlefield for a minority.

50 : Buttercups88Comment: You have a lot there , but you ignore what people mean by collapse and dying... It's not going to fall into the ocean.


The US is showing fractures, and it's giving up the very advantages that made it a global power to begin with.


But even after such a fall happens, many Americans will simply refuse to believe it and that is largely what we are seeing. They believe their own propaganda now, same as the Russians. Undefeatable military, unrivaled power, everyone jealous of our greatness... If any of that sounds familiar your already down that road.


But go to England, or Italy, or France, you will find no shortage of people who believe they are the powerful empire they once were and are simply graciously allowing others to stand up themselves. There is nothing you can ever say to those groups to change their minds, their military can't be stopped "if we went all out no one could stand against us" is a common theme. I've heard Brits in particular brag about their special forces and nuclear submarines being the best in the world and the US begs them for any of their training cause they are so many times better... I doubt you hear the same thing in the states.


Your 2A is a interesting take... But it doesn't work that way. How do I know? Well you got plain clothes masked agents abducting people off the street and no one has done anything. A takeover isn't suddenly military coming in and subduing a population, it's stopping certain people who speak out then increasing surveillance and policing. It's not military rolling in looking like target's to take shots at, it's specifically targeted people and organization calling them terrorists or traitors until the only people left either support the military or regime otherwise won't speak out against them out of fear.


You have a good argument BUT it actually says the opposite of what you think. It shows a ingrained belief that regardless of what happens the US will persevere because of their exceptionalism, that they are different fundamentally than those who fell to the same traps that so many others have, that the military can't be rivaled(ironically the exact same thing the other powers believe about theirs). This belief that you are given authority by power and your power is granted by God or because you are more righteous or because you are better by birthright or province or you'll come out on top just keep calm and carry on or whatever excuse you feel like using this week is what kills world powers.... You won't collapse into the sea, you will just enjoy the same type of power the UK has, internally many believing you are still the envy of the world but the rest of the world doesn't reflect this

And notice 6000 years of limiting the executive branch from country to country as Europeans left middle east and Egypt. But after the invention of the radio, power flowed to the executive with more and more bureaucracies and rulings in their favor. You could see this shift in the beginning of the third reich and user and china, as political leaders preached doctrine of various forms of socialism and presenting it as utopias (resulting in battles and starvation that in the first time in history climbed into the millions of deaths). 

Rome had a panic attack as everyone realized that the minting of coinage was diluted with higher percentage of another metal other than silver (they debased their currency). Rome resorted to hierarchy rule via military power than economic powers. Then numerous ceasers attacked the Senate (and if you can just attack the Senate you can make what ever laws you want) and northern Rome fell as the bryzantines became independent. You can see this happening as scotus rules against the trump administration and now even making contempt of court against the administration impossible. And congress capitulating their power of the purse to trump after January 6th just as the Roman Senate did after being attacked. 

All these events don't make us "stronger". As early populations could leave the country on count of an oppressive executive (kings, pharaohs, emperors) and accomplish their dreams without being encroached on (the world executive branches of governments became very sensitive to human rights because their most brilliant and industrious could move and make an opposing power tower over them). Now however as politicians preach utopias that will end in failure going to somewhere that isn't infected by their delusional sense of "justice" is far more difficult. Edward Snowden for example had to try and apply for asylum for 20 countries to get away from the US executive as to speak out of gross violations of the executive. Again tragic events don't make us "stronger" as a country their just an excuse for further abuse of power.

54 : Imaginary_Ambition78Comment: I disagree with the 2A point, the government has the ENTIRE military of USA, aka the strongest nation in terms of military, in their hands. They will barely need to send actual soldiers unless situation got rly out of control. In this HYPOTHETICAL scenario where US military is fighting US civilians, they COULD absolutely flatten every protest. Also, the military ABSOLUTELY will bomb their own citizens.

Its not like the president who will do all this will be unpopular, he will have support from many american citizens and only those protesting will get targeted in name of protecting democracy. Even the people in the military will slowly be replaced by those who support the president unconditionally in the years leading up to the full dictatorship mode of the country, thats the step 1 u need to make the military doesnt turn against u.

Good thing is I dont any of this will happen but Im just saying guns wont do anything

55 : Putrefied_GoblinComment: Collapse doesn't occur overnight, or even four years (usually). Trump is a symptom of a much deeper problem with our society, culture, and system. There is no going back after this; he is testing our system, and it is failing, so unless we make laws to fix it, e.g. limit executive powers, provide a clearer and stronger way for courts to enforce decisions, make laws sufficiently strong so when a Congress and Executive are lockstep they can't just burn everything down. I don't think we'll be able to fix most of these problems. 

Also, climate change/global warming is going to fuck up everything beyond what many seem able to conceptualize. Global warming will lead to widespread collapse of not only global ecosystems (we're already in a human caused mass extinction), but also economies and food production. We aren't prepared, and that will lead to collapse if Trumpian style populism/proto-fascism doesn't.

56 : Xavier1235Comment: I agree with your overall points. I think the internet has homogenized some reactions to events for certain groups which makes it feel more present and pressing then it would otherwise be. I recommend a podcast called “fall of civilizations” it shows in every example civilizations don’t exactly collapse into nothing. It’s usually a slow process and not everyone in the moment are all unified into the same narrative. It’s only later historians decide what the main historical narrative may be. The US could go on for 1000 more years but historians could perhaps point to this period as the start of future troubles. As long as people exist to witness events you’ll have some yahoos proclaiming the end is nigh. But it never truly is and even if it is you probably wouldn’t notice. Collapse of civilizations are not as dramatic as we think they are.

America is not a “fetus”, it is one of the oldest continually functioning governments on Earth. When Germany fell after WWII, that Germany died. The thriving Germany we’ve seen since then is a totally new institution built around the shared cultural heritage of Germany. The fears that the America we know now is dying aren’t unfounded, it may very well not exist in a century (in its current form). Whatever might replace it will be something new

Germany was leveled - utterly decimated - as a result of that war. The ONLY reason they are thriving is because the US and other nations rebuilt their country.  Do you expect there would be someone to do that for us?

Oh, and half their country was reduced to a poor vassal state for 40 years.

And they are still dealing with the guilt of The Holocaust.

You're example of Nazi Germany...makes no sense. We are heading in that direction. That's exactly what someone arguing we are heading towards collapse would say.

2 : shockpawsComment: 1. Generally people who push traditional gender roles for one gender push them for both. I doubt you’re seeing too many people who say BOTH of these things; you might just be seeing people say one or the other and conflating them based on demographics.
2. Saying that men should provide something in a relationship doesn't necessitate that they be the SOLE provider. It’s possible in the context people are saying this in that they’re just expressing that they want their partner to have *some* form of employment or income to equally contribute to the house.
3. I believe that regardless of the above points, expecting men to be providers (which is not something I agree with, btw) is STILL less sexist than saying women belong in the kitchen, because a “provider” is an “in-charge / leadership” position and a cook/housemaid/etc is a subservient position. Neither is good and both are sexist, but one is very much so more degrading than the other. I mean, which expectation would *you* rather have?

**ETA—**

Did NOT expect for OP's post to blow up like this, did not expect that many responses. I wrote this comment entirely on a whim on mobile while half-asleep so some of my reasoning wasn't properly fleshed out, apologies! Don't feel like responding to every single one so I'm just gonna cover some of the common responses and elaborate on my intentions.

* Apparently there are more people than I thought who are hypocrites. My bad. Generally I don't see too many people who claim from the jump that they have weird views on whether or not gender roles should be followed (I do see plenty of men expecting cooking/cleaning and 50/50 finances, but that's not often *stated* and moreso behavioral) but that might just be the spaces I personally spend my time in.
* WRT my phrasing of point three, the true difference isn't really in the emotional *experience* of it, its in the **independence.** If we follow all gender roles to their ultimate conclusion, a SAHM has absolutely *zero* ability to financially leave her husband. She hasn't worked in a number of years, doesn't have the job experience she should for her age, is the primary caretaker of children which is hugely expensive moneywise and timewise, etcetera. Her husband, though, *can pack up and leave at any time he wants.* This power dynamic *will* inherently shape the relationship whether they intend it to or not: one of them has much more of a stake in the relationship continuing than the other.
   * No, I don't think alimony or child support is enough to make up for this, especially because you won't be getting any of that until you're able to hire a lawyer, which is expensive, and until legal proceedings conclude, which takes a lot of time. This is discouraging enough to prevent many unhappy women from divorcing.
* If women ever "control" the purchasing power / household management, yadda yadda in relationships that follow strict gender roles, this is entirely based on soft power or may even be a result of men being checked out of those tasks (those tasks *which are work*, btw). See my previous point — she has zero *actual recourse* if her husband decides on something she doesn't like.
* When you're at work, you have worker's rights and sometimes the option for union membership/representation. As a housewife, you are entirely subject to the whims of your husband and his mood as to whether you are doing a "good job"; essentially placing you in a sort of boss/employee dynamic despite the fact that you are in a romantic relationship. You have no guaranteed hours, no inherently guaranteed pay, etc. I can't figure out the right keywords to track down the literature, but one of my supervisors explained to me last year that burnout is much higher in people who live where they work (eg RAs, camp counselors) because there's a lack of separation between their "on" time and their "off" time at home. She can never *truly* relax.
* I don't think service jobs are inherently degrading. I personally choose to work those jobs myself. I just take issue with service jobs in romantic relationships because I think it creates an uncomfortable hierarchical dynamic.

The end, those are my opinions unless I can think of more.

3 : Maple_butterflyComment: I think an important point you are overlooking is the history of gender issues that lead to sentiments like this. “Women belong in the kitchen” is a statement that carries the weight of historically women not being allowed to work many high paying jobs, women not being allowed to have credit cards, being a stay at home mom not just being a social norm but a relatively strict social restriction on top of all the other historic discriminations women have faced. “Men should be breadwinner” is essentially proof of a historic power dynamic that was largely established by men over most of history. 

It’s hard to call both statements equally sexist when one is rooted in historic discriminations and the other is a role that was established in social power, was far more valued and only recently spoken out against.

4 : snezna_kraljicaComment: "In my view the belief that men should be providers who protect women is incredibly sexists" 

By definition it is sexist. There is no argument or view or anything here, this can't be changed.

Is your view to be challenged that some (who?) think that it's not sexist or that sexism is not detestable? Or that sexism against men is overlooked?

Care to elaborate?

What does the man put  in to equalize that contribution in his column?  Children take a lot of time, pain, and effort to raise.  If the man doesn't provide, then what is his role in setting up the family for success?  Does he just drop off the sperm and boom all parties are equally participating in the family arrangment?
--------------------
--------------------
6 : CeleryMan20Comment: In a world where a family can survive on one income, “men belong in the workplace” and “women belong in the kitchen” are two sides of the same coin. And thus are equally sexist, in line with your premise. For single-income households, one party works for formal pay, by definition; and the other members receive indirect economic benefit, either in return for their household labour, or because they are supported dependents (e.g. young children, disability, etc.) 

Conservatives want to conserve traditional values, and will say that it is right and proper that men should be have that breadwinner role because tradition, or because religion, or because evolutionary psychology (protect the breeding stock). You mentioned Manosphere spaces, from what I’ve seen they seem to have a fair share of the evo-psych type of gender essentialism (our ancestors were hunters, etc.). It should be socially acceptable to have a working mum and a stay-home dad, but that is uncommon in our society. (And what of same-sex couples?)

The reality where I live is that you need two incomes. Then it becomes a question of how equitably the roles are split. If one partner works fewer hours, should they contribute more at home? If they work similar hours, but make more money, does that count for more? 

“Men must be the provider” has gradations. From sole-income, through working more hours, to working similar hours but expected to bring in more money, to providing the money _and_ the housework. 

There are still cultural expectations. Perhaps the man isn’t the sole income, but he is still expected to earn more. Women are still expected (on average) to contribute more at home. Are they both sexist? Yes, so I’m still not changing your view. 

There is this idea that going out to work has a kind of freedom and self-actualisation that home work does not. But stay-home dads often report that it is hard, rewarding, and different from paid work, but not necessarily easier or harder. 

The online femosphere denizens who say “I don’t need to bring anything to the table, I am the table” want to be all take and no give. They want to have a hobby job as an influencer, whilst “high-value men” treat them like princesses and bring in the proper money. Online, it feels like “all (most) women are like that”, but the reality is that it’s a vocal group of “boss bitch”/“slay queen” types

It’s hard to change your view, when (a) I generally agree with you, (b) there are so many other variables in relationships, and (c) we see so much confounding rhetoric. 

The area where I think expectations on women are more onerous is the “supermum” stereotype, where women are told that they can and should juggle career, motherhood, and mistress of the household. On the plus side, there is more choice: career women are no longer vilified, men’s roles are more constrained. But the imperative in some circles for women to “do it all” is no good, if men are getting a free pass. The attitude that women should go to to work and still belong in the kitchen when they get home - it’s not universal, but does have some traction. 

Conversely, there is this idea that “female hypergamy” requires “6 figures, 6 feet, 6 inches” and places old-fashioned requirements for male suitors to meet traditional expectations, whilst freeing women from their traditional constraints. In that sense “men should be providers” is maybe not more sexist, but more _persistently_ sexist. “Woman belongs in the kitchen” is no longer widely supported, but “man should be the provider” still is. In this sense, men’s liberation is lagging behind women’s. 

So take your pick, perhaps one is “more sexist” than the other, or vice versa.

Of course, not all relationships are fair. They can range from partners trying their best, to full-on abusive manipulation. And neither men nor women have a monopoly on that.

8 : RickyNixonComment: In a world where all men are providers and all women are homemakers, that means men control ALL the resources, have all the freedom, etc, and women stay at the houses they own and keep them clean and stuff and hope that men continue to provide them with a means to survive.

The two positions are both sexist, and sexism hurts everybody. But they are wildly different in terms of outcomes, and I think we have to consider that fact. In the world these ideas came from, women were slaves, they had a legal status comparable to children, and men controlled the world. Is going back to that world equally bad for both parties?

Now, the crushing weight/pressure men suffer from under the patriarchal framework isnt good for them either. Sexism is bad for everyone. But it is patriarchal, BOTH ideas are patriarchal, and they do not hurt men and women *equally*.

9 : Sallad3Comment: How would you define "just as sexist"? I agree as far as they're both discriminatory and wrong, and that both can have shitty consequences for both.


I'd however argue that "belong in the kitchen" has an inherent component that the other lacks in terms of consequences. A person not working will lose independency/become dependent on others and have a worse financial and career situation thar will follow them for the rest of their lives even if they escape their situation later. They are also more likely become trapped in a shitty relationship. 


That's not to say that "expected to be a provider" will always be better for the individual, e.g for one individual the provider expectation might result in suicide while another individual is happily a stay at home mom. 


To summarize, both can have serious psychological consequences, both are wrong, but "belong in the kitchen" has the additional financial component and can as such be argued to be more sexist.


Edit: One is also an expectation to be competent while the other is often telling the other person is incompetent. I'd personally generally prefer the former.

A lot of the men who think a woman's place is at home cooking, cleaning and raising children are the same men who don't have the means to provide for this lifestyle. If you want a stay at home wife/mother then you definitely should be a provider. 

Too many guys want submissive providers. Women who do all the traditional stuff while also working full time. IMHO a modern man who wants an equal relationship begets a modern woman who will be as much a provider as he is. A traditional man who can provide for a family will beget a traditional woman who wants to make that family with him. But a modern man wanting a traditional woman is just laughable, as is the vice versa scenario.

14 : SendMeYourDPicsComment: You’re not wrong that it’s sexist, but framing them as equally sexist misses something. 

The “men must provide” thing screws men, yeah - traps them in this grind-or-die model where their worth is tied to money or status - but it also props up the system that tells women they can’t or shouldn’t provide for themselves. That’s the part people miss. 

These roles are linked, but they don’t land equally. One puts pressure on you, the other takes power from someone else. That doesn’t make your frustration invalid, it just means they operate on different levels. 

You don’t have to rank oppression like it’s a competition, but ignoring that imbalance weakens your case. The role hurts you because it helps keep her stuck in hers. That’s why it matters.
--------------------
--------------------
15 : catharsynccComment: I think most people who claim one also claim the other.

That being said, the data is pretty clear about who carries the majority of household labor, even in cases where both partners work equal amounts. I can understand why women would be frustrated about doing the majority of chores while financially contributing the same amount as their partner, and I could see why some women would come away from that expecting a man to be a "provider"; it may be easier to convince a man to earn more money for a household than it would be to convince him to consistently contribute to chores.

I've been in a relationship where I was the primary provider and my bf still didn't contribute very much to chores. He overinflated anything he did do, and got angry if I pointed out he didn't do something he was supposed to (i.e. "I can't believe you'd get on my case about not washing the dishes while you were at work, when I cleared and wiped the table, and you should've been proud of me for that"). Convincing a guy who doesn't want to do chores to do chores is an endless battle that needs won over and over and over again. Convincing a guy to seek a promotion/find a new job is a battle that, presumably, only needs to be won one time.

I'm currently in a happy relationship. When we started living together, my fiance earned a lot less than me. Later on, we were earning the same amount. And when I quit one of my jobs due to health concerns, there was a period he was earning slightly more. Because I want an equal relationship, household roles have shifted somewhat as income and work hours change. Because I work relatively few hours a week, and get paid a higher rate, I have more time at home. So since I quit my second job, I've been doing stuff like preparing his lunches for work and doing a larger share of cleaning. When he wasn't earning/working a ton, he did more cleaning. We've talked about how a stretch goal is for my fiance to be able to cut hours at work (from 40 to like 30) even if that means I work a little bit more (though I'm trying to get health stuff in order first), and I've taken steps toward a new side hustle that I'm hoping I'll be able to develop into an income stream. It helps that gender isn't a factor — while my ex talked a lot about roles of men and women and their differences, my fiance doesn't particularly care. He's trans, and I don't really *get* gender roles, so those expectations aren't a part of the relationship.

The point is, relationships don't have a specific way they need to be. But striving for equity is important. I can't understand being in a relationship and *wanting* to offload your burdens onto your partner. This is a person you love, why would you want to create an arrangement that places undue labor and stress onto them? But unfortunately that type of arrangement is all-too common in straight couples.

16 : AgnesBandComment: &gt;Claiming that men should be providers is as sexist as claiming that women belong in the kitchen

&gt;providers who protect women

Which is it? Providing and protecting aren't the same thing. If someone doesn't think women belong in the kitchen, by definition they don't think men should be the *sole* providers. The two are mutually exclusive and you are preaching to the choir.

If you're only talking about protcting women, protect from what? From who?

If we're talking fight for improved women's rights to protect them from abuses, exploitation, then yes I think that's a moral pursuit. Protect abortion rights? Protect from sexual harassment? Protect from domestic violence? These are all things everyone can work towards, including men. 

If you're physically able, or even if you're not, attempting to protect a woman from say an attacker on the street, is also the morally correct thing to do. That's not to be paternalistic and say women can't also protect other women, or themselves, but it sure helps if other men aren't bystanders.

Should we force men to help in situations like that? Well that's debatable. Do I think men *should* help in situations like that? Yes I do, but I think all of society should. We should look after each other.

If I'm barking up the wrong tree then you need to be more specific about what you mean because you have been quite vague.

18 : FalconHorror384Comment: I think what you’re hitting on OP is that both of these are the result of toxic patriarchal beliefs.

So claiming the men should be providers is not “as sexist” as others have already made the case for, but it is something that stems from the same root cause as “women belong in the kitchen” and it still sexist. 

Throughout 2nd wave feminism, there are a lot of writers that talk about how patriarchy hurts both genders and I’d argue this expectation along with the expectation that men be stoic and unfeeling are all part of that.

I have no idea how prevalent feminism currently is, but I am a feminist and am the breadwinner and have no expectation that my husband SHOULD be the breadwinner. I think we both need to work. I think whoever can make more does it and we share the other household loads as much as we can.

I know this kind of rhetoric is prevalent in some of the man o sphere spaces online right now. I invite men who dislike the expectation of bread winning to challenge the idea of it as “natural” within themselves and ask how that belief helps uphold current systems of control.

19 : Ania_Lost-LibraryComment: Claiming that men should be providers is as sexist as saying women belong in the kitchen — and both stereotypes are rooted in the same outdated system.

I believe both of these gender roles are deeply harmful. They may manifest differently, but they stem from the same source: a patriarchal structure that historically assigned rigid roles to men and women. While the role of “man as provider” may appear noble or even empowering on the surface, it is, in reality, a constraint — just as confining and reductive as expecting women to be caretakers or housewives by default.

That said, there is an important nuance. The origins of these stereotypes lie in a patriarchal system that was, for centuries, dominated by men — or more precisely, by the majority of men in past societies who benefited from institutional power and cultural norms. This system unquestionably oppressed women far more severely, denying them education, autonomy, and basic rights.

However, in many parts of the world today, we’ve seen meaningful progress in women’s rights and freedoms — even if the work is far from finished. In contrast, men now often find themselves trapped in the very system their ancestors helped build. They are expected to be providers, to suppress emotion, to avoid vulnerability, and to define their worth by wealth or dominance. These expectations are not liberating; they are limiting and dehumanizing.

Still, we must be cautious not to frame men solely as victims. While today’s men did not invent these roles, many still unconsciously — or consciously — uphold them. The responsibility now lies with everyone, regardless of gender, to challenge and dismantle these stereotypes.

We also can’t ignore the interdependence of these roles: the idea that men should provide is closely linked to the notion that women should depend. These aren’t just isolated beliefs — they reinforce each other. Real progress means rejecting both sides of this binary.

So yes, asserting that men should be providers is sexist. It might not lead to the same level of systemic violence or exclusion women have historically faced, but it is still a form of gender-based restriction. In the end, freedom means allowing individuals — all individuals — to define their own path without coercion, expectation, or shame.

20 : RalynneComment: The only way I could see this coming up where you would not be correct is if it's a situation where men are talking about wanting a baby-maker/caretaker wife, and the reaction they get is to be told that they need to be good providers if that's what they want in a partner. 


In most conversations and contexts you're totally right and all gendered expectations that push someone into a specific role are sexist bullshit. In the very narrow category of one party saying that they want a romantic partner who is fulfilling that very gendered role, it's not "equally bad" to tell them that they have to live up to their side of the equation first. For two reasons-- one, it's a rhetorical device to point out that someone doesn't actually want what they say they want by pointing out the downsides, akin to telling a child that they can of course buy as much McDonald's as they want as soon as they have their own money. Two, there are in fact people of both genders who prefer traditional roles and if a man actually wants a 1950's housewife type, or if a woman actually wants a big tough guy that does all the financial providing, then those people need to be prepared to live up to their side of those expectations. Pointing that out isn't sexist, even if the actual underlying social structure is sexist as hell.

21 : Ok-Condition-6932Comment: It is equally harmful to push that nobody has a role.

These things have worked and are beneficial for society. 

Just look how much we shot ourselves in the foot with "equal rights."

Yes, I know that sounds insane when you say it that way.  But its true.  Was it such a bad deal that 2 incomes wasn't the default?

When you see a mother miserable working at Walmart to support a family, remember thats ehat they want.  You cant have it both ways. Competition and free markets dont care about your feelings or morality.  Now we ALL have to play the stupid game and partake in the rat race.

I dont think women "belong in the kitchen."  All I'm saying is, is that such a bad thing if they were in the kitchen dealing with a whole different type of taking care of the family?  

Society knows specialization is better than not.  A family has potential to benefit from two specialist, instead of splitting everything 50/50 between husband and wife.  

Seriously think about it.  Should *both* become an expert in general construction to fix the house?  Should *both* master culinary arts?  Jack of all trades will never be "worth" special skill.

22 : Appropriate_Dig_7616Comment: Maybe this is a bad take, it's fine to disagree with me, but gender roles on their own aren't a bad thing. If they're used to try to limit a person's freedom then that's bad. If they're used to ridicule a relationship where the traditional roles are reversed then that's bad. But saying that a man should provide is absolutely fine, like yeah you should want to provide for your family, or at the very least for yourself. I personally find it encouraging and I'd never use it as an excuse to prevent my wife from achieving her own goals.

And maybe this is just me, but I feel that the thing many of us long for most nowadays is a happy, quiet life. I'm not interested in tearing down the structures around us, because I don't have faith we'll build something better in their place. I want to focus on small, measurable goals, not impossibly broad and academic discussions. If we have a belief system that encourages people to earn money and provide for their loved ones that's a good thing in my books.
--------------------
--------------------
23 : BitcoinMDComment: Belonging in the kitchen is way more specific than being a provider, so you could make the argument that it’s more sexist because it’s more restrictive.
--------------------
--------------------
24 : lustyforpeachesComment: From some of your follow up responses I know this won’t change your mind, but just a different perspective: neither are sexist if it works for the couple, both are just as sexist if made requirements of one party. 

Earlier someone said it’s more sexist for women to be caretakers because they have less power and I just flat out disagree, bc men aren’t all bad, some women want to be caretakers, and in healthy relationships, nothing takes the respect or power away from either party. Nothing. 

My husband and I are interested in having kids and discuss me staying at home sometimes. I’m not sure yet which way we land, but I know for damn sure that “power” won’t diminish either way. We love each other and our choices are made for each other and the life we want to build together, not for ourselves alone.

26 : maraemerald2Comment: If a woman wants to have children, she absolutely needs to pick a man who can in a pinch provide for most if not all of the household’s basic needs. Pregnancy can be completely debilitating and our country has no safety nets. 

My own mother was in a car accident at 4 months pregnant and was put on partial bed rest for the rest of her pregnancy. That’s 5 months without wages, plus another 2-3 for recovering after the birth. They cut expenses to the bone and my dad was luckily able to pick up the slack.

This situation is not uncommon, it’s happened to multiple women that I know. 

A woman saying she needs to find a man who can provide in that situation is just acknowledging the practical reality that men aren’t the ones who get debilitated from pregnancy.

27 : sleepyncaffeinatedComment: Absolutely. If you think about it, one leads to the other. Abolishing gender roles not only benefits women.

28 : F_DOG_93Comment: Depends. Many men are happy and even make it their life's mission to provide for their family. I grew up around a community where many of the women didn't work and all of the men provided for them. The men were very happy to work hard and provide their their families. Many women were happy to stay home, and make the house a home, and raise the children. In fact, they had such a strong community, that women would go out for picnics with eachother and even cooked together. Many of the men were working together and we're very happy to work long hours to ensure their women and children could live happily and comfortably. Many men would feel unfulfilled if they weren't providing for their family. Much more than the amount of women that would feel unfulfilled.

29 : ActPositivelyComment: Literally 100% of the feminists I know are hypocrites. Caveat is all the ones I know are in there 20s or 30s but I think a lot of society has the same views. According to those people and most of society they say they want equality. But in reality they want equality when it benefits women but still expect men to hold certain gender roles. So for example they still want men to pay for the 1st dates, pay for the majority of dates and pay for the majority of the bills in a relationship versus equality would be 50/50. If a wife is a stay at home mom and the dad is working 80+ hours weeks they still expect the man to do half the chores and childcare. They expect the man to be the protector and sacrifice himself for his girlfriend/wife. Etc

30 : HoboSamurai420Comment: It depends entirely on your perspective and your life situation. If you are a single guy and you just want to go your own way, I see nothing wrong with that.
But if you choose to bring children into the world you had damn well be prepared to feed and care for them. Once you make the conscious decision to start a family, you should be the figurehead of that family and lead everyone forward. Now with that being said, I do not expect my spouse to be some “barefoot and in the kitchen” type. In fact I kind of hate that. I want a strong independent woman who is an equal. Which means we share responsibilities equally as well. I already know how to cook and do my own laundry

31 : EggplantBasic7135Comment: It’s not a view as much as it was the biologically smart thing to do for most of humanity. Only recently where our society and needs have changed to be incredibly different from what they were 100 years ago. Now a days society has made it so that anyone can succeed and be independent so the normal roles people had to fill to survive before no longer exist. It’s just statistically the objective truth that a mom that is active in raising their kids (which often times requires the man to make all of the income to allow the mom to spend as much time and effort as they do raising a child) along with a caring and responsible father is the healthiest way to raise a child.
--------------------
--------------------
32 : BlairiansComment: It's just biology, when women get pregnant their bodies go through radical changes that many times  need someone to help care for them. They aren't able to continue to work and intense schedule with high stress in late pregnancy. It doesn't mean men are destined to work themselves to death, but guys should take extra care both physically and take a greater load of work when their wives are farther in pregnancy.




Many women also discover while pregnant, that they really want to spend more time with their baby after they are born. This often will necessitate that the other partner takes the greater work load. Affluent couples will often hire a nanny or Au Paire, but most families just can't afford that kind of luxury.


Full disclosure my house is a single income home, I have worked an intense work schedule for the past 19 years (usually 12+ hour shifts 5 x weekly) to support my family, and it is exhausting and challenging.

33 : CrossXFir3Comment: In fact, this very idea is hurting men in gen z disproportionately as gen z women are on average, getting higher education levels than gen z men, and thus make more money than gen z men on average. However, there is an additional problem. Men are being raised to be providers and on average, offer less around the house and as parents. I don't blame men for this, this is how they were raised. However, now that women don't need men to provide in gen z as much, they're expecting a greater emotional commitment, that men aren't used to and it's one of the many reasons for the loneliness epidemic.
--------------------
--------------------
34 : SnappyDogDaysComment: Aside from all the triggering incel, redpill, man rights stuff, a lot of the "provider" or protector comes just from evolution and biology.   

Men are just physically stronger than women.  That makes it easier to provide resources and protection from other men.

As a species, we haven't evolved enough to not need men to protect women from other men, build buildings, machines, tools, etc. 

Maybe in 100 years we'll have enough robots building other robots, that can build those buildings, machines, and tools, and that can provide resources and protection from other men.

35 : SameAsThePasswordComment: It’s actually not sexist, just dumb. Do you want your woman learning to bake and making your family fat? That’s a grandma‘s job. Get a gas top grill that has open flames so you can cook like a man over fire with heavy metal implements. Show women that they have no place in the kitchen unless and until they raise children who start raising children. Make them earn that right so they appreciate it again. Or just dominate in the kitchen and ask yourself why the hell you’d want a partner to do that for you.
--------------------
--------------------
36 : RulesBeDamnedComment: Men and women are socially directed into these roles. They are more likely to be better at those jobs than their heterosexual counterparts, at least if you look strictly at outcomes.

But to appease the living pathogens who think I’m advocating for this division, the only reason this exists is because parents keep pushing their kids into these roles. If we stopped treating women in the workplace like trophies and men with children like red flags, maybe we’d have more egalitarian relationship divisions.
--------------------
--------------------
37 : henri-a-laflemmeComment: I do somewhat agree, but these expectations don’t hold the same weight. I relate on a personal level because I’m a man who grew up to stay childless, and I’ll never be a provider for a family. 

It did disappoint my dad and some of the family that I don’t want the traditional American dream and just want to live to provide for myself and my partner, but that pressure didn’t extend beyond that. Society in general is a lot more accepting of a childless man than a childless woman.
--------------------
--------------------
38 : hungrychopperComment: Sexism implies some kind of disadvantage with respect to whatever the norm or expectation is. But being able to provide for my girlfriend has been nothing but beneficial to my relationship. I like holding myself to that standard, and it’s helped me make healthier choices in my life as a result because now I have both of our welfare to consider. I’m not gonna force anyone to act the way I act, but if anyone asks what makes our relationship work this is a big part of it.
--------------------

39 : AggressiveAd69xComment: Some day reddit will learn that most men and women (read the average experience) is that men have a subconscious need to provide and protect and women have a subconscious need to love and nurture. Nothing about that is sexist, it's as true to the experience as the average dog wanting to piss on a hydrant. 

Let people choose what makes them happy, don't guilt them. None of this is sexism. It's just biology and how the human animal operates.

40 : RepresentativeGas354Comment: Being a provider is not a degrading term. Being told you belong to the kitchen is.

41 : AcrobaticProgram4752Comment: It's biological. Babies take yrs to raise and both baby and mother are vulnerable at that time. It's a survival thing to have a protector and provider when a women must tend a kid and a kid needs so long to develop. Other animals can walk and run soon after birth. They've much shorter periods of becoming capable of tending themselves. This isn't some sexist construct but an effective method of survival for our species.

42 : ZenMystComment: I agree. I want to live however I want but society expect me to conform to the notion of “being a man” that they decided. 

Both alpha male and divine feminine women have shamed me for not wanting to be in the traditional role of a man. 

They say I’m not manly. Ok then I’m not manly. I only need to be happy, not manly. These people are not going of make me happy. So why should I listen to them.
--------------------
--------------------
43 : garlicroastedpotatoComment: Within limits.

Women have to take between 3-6 months off of work to take care of a child for those first few months.  Men are just not biologically capable of producing milk and thus aren't a natural replacement for taking care of children.  We were very fortunate we could both afford to take time off.  But if we couldn't it would have been me providing for those first six months minimum.
--------------------
--------------------
44 : ButchDeanCAComment: Let me start by saying this, I do believe in traditional gender roles. We have never had so many problems as we do today at the family level since they were essentially abandoned.

But, given the modern “female empowerment” movement it is now sexist to expect men to provide, for if women can do everything men can (which is patently false in both directions), why the expectation now?
--------------------
--------------------
45 : FunOptimal7980Comment: It is sexist. It made sense when women couldn't work or had less opportunities for good pay. But these days young women often earn as much or even more than men. The discrepancy in earnings is concentrated among older people.

But surveys also show that a lot of women still expect men to earn more than them or be at least equal, though it is changing slowly. Men tend to care way less about that stuff though.
--------------------
--------------------
46 : Dull-Investigator-17Comment: I don't think it's the NATURAL role of a man to provide in our modern society except for the time before and after birth. 

Once the mother has healed, it's a question of who will provide childcare. The person who does not, needs to provide financially.

In a relationship without children, the gender of the partners is irrelevant for who provides.
--------------------

47 : Unlikely_Bluebird892Comment: OF COURSE

4 WOMEN I HAVE DATED OR I WANTED TO DATE TOLD ME THESE TWO WEEKS : "MEN SHOULD PROVIDE FOR 100% OF THE HOUSEHOLD NEEDS", "HER MONEY IS HER MONEY AND HIS MONEY IS HER MONEY TOO", "IF HE REFUSES IT MEANS HE HAS FEMININE ENERGY AND IS NOT A REAL MAN".

I laughed at this and promised to never consider them again as potential partners.

Either in 2016 or 2020 he would not have been able to enact his agenda and would have been stonewalled by a republican or truncated congress. His supporters would just stay home in the next election and he would quickly become very unpopular as M4A isn’t enacted. Moreover his health would be arguably worse than Biden as Sanders is older and already had a heart attack, so he would not be a physically good shape to run for re-election. If elected in 2016, he is labeled as a commie for lockdowns and tossed out. If elected in 2020, he is unable to do anything in the aftermath of covid as republicans would stonewall his budgets, his supreme court pick, and possibly a cabinet pick or two. This puts any longterm goal of Sanders’ in a coma with no clear plan forward.  

Since he was more likely to win in 2020 we will go over there, the senate ended up at 50/50, but since Sanders would have to resign, the republican governor of Vermont would appoint the 51st senator, making it 49/51. That means, no student debt cancelation, no green new deal, no M4A, and no tax overhaul. His voters would just believe him to be a liar or just grow to apathetic to show up in the Midterms while republicans turn out on mass to “defeat communism”. In the lead up to 2024 Sanders may run, and likely lose, or hand it to his VP.

2 : SatanicLemonsComment: 2020? Yes, agreed. I think it would have done decent damage to the progressive movement in the US had he have won, and I think both parties are happy it was Biden handling the sh-tshow during and post-pandemic. That was a popularity sinkhole for politicians. 

2016 though? I disagree. 

Just to get it out of the way immediately, we know from Hindsight that Sanders was able to still work in government from 2017-2021 without kicking the bucket, or coming all that close to that, so the health argument is not one I think can be used if we are talking about 16’. 

Sanders, had he have won in 16’. Would have beaten Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. 

This would mean there would have been no controversy regarding the Democratic Party establishment thwarting populist movements, and would have proved to the republican party that further moderating, especially on messaging and social issues to compete for seats in government. 

This alone, and its impact on the midterms would have kept Sanders popularity well above “extremely unpopular”. 

Sure M4A and other deeply progressive parts of his agenda would have not been likely to come to fruition in the 2017-2021 congresses, and I won’t bother delving too deeply into the hypothetical scenarios where he flips tons of seats from conservatives and moderates to liberals and progressives, because frankly, it’s a waste of time. 

What matters more however, is the impact of his veto power. It is my main criticism of your argument that it does not well enough consider that with Sanders guarding each and every bill’s passing that you would see much more carefully addressed policies, especially when it comes to effects on the health of the middle/working class. 

This in my view changes quite a bit. I believe you would see significant support for his states positions on a lot of legislation throughout the country. This is because despite his headline worthy statements and very progressive speeches, Sanders is pragmatic in a way that the average American can relate to. 

Just take the gun control debates from the primaries. Sanders was criticized for being “too soft” because he suggested that *gun control* is a completely different topic of debate when talking about NYC vs. rural Vermont, and that certain policies concessions should be considered by progressives especially in certain states. I’ll never forget what a breath of fresh air this realistic position was. 

That’s the difference for me. Most conservatives may not like him ever, and some progressives may be upset over him not being able to pass things like M4A like they expected, but overall I would argue at least 45% of Americans would feel like they have a president who was focused on keeping us out of wars, keeping the lower and middle classes protected, and maintaining a good objective viewpoint on many issues not clouded by wealthier interests. 

Can’t guarantee that everyone would see it that way, but I would argue that “extremely unpopular” would be almost impossible. Even if he failed to bring about a single massive progressive policy change, he would at least be within a few points of where the last president finished, which was largely neutral.

3 : SwaayyzeeComment: You don’t need to make a hypothetical about his health, we can see both their health with hindsight now. Bernie has not aged worse than Biden in any sense.

4 : blyzoComment: I think you're dismissing the power of the bully pulpit and Sanders willingness to use it. 

He could be on TV everyday talking about wealth inequality and universal health care. Two already popular things that he could make even more popular. He's also able and willing to hold a 10k person rally in the district of any key swing Congressperson. 

I think his domestic agenda would be very popular, but he would probably be more left on foreign policy than people are comfortable with so unpopular there. 

Overall though Bernie's approval rating has always been high. People like him because he's seen as honest and authentic so I don't see people changing their minds on that outside of some corruption scandal.
--------------------
--------------------
5 : danielt1263Comment: So to be clear... You are not saying that Sanders would be unpopular because of M4A or any other policy he was trying to enact. Rather you are saying that he would become unpopular because the Republicans would refuse to accept his leadership.

In essence then, your view is that the Republicans can stonewall and refuse to play ball, but their popularity will not suffer; instead the popularity of the person they are pouncing on would.

So, I guess your view would apply if *anybody* on the democratic side of the isle that won in those two elections (including Biden), yes? Or is there something specifically about Sanders that would make him particularly unappealing?
--------------------
--------------------
6 : pavilionaire2022Comment: Your assumption is that Republicans would not vote for any agenda Bernie put forward, which is maybe true. Obviously, Bernie could have tried the same agenda as Biden with equal lack of success, but you are overlooking the possibility of doing a deal.

What if Bernie threatened to veto a bunch of bills that favored corporate interests unless a few Republicans backed some moderate version of his socialist agenda. Maybe it wouldn't be Medicare For All, but it could be a Medicare / Medicaid expansion. Since Bernie's agenda is pretty popular, a few Republicans might not be afraid of voting for it, and since Bernie isn't tied to corporate interests, he wouldn't be afraid to make good on the threat of torpedoing their bills.

--------------------
7 : ThatOneGuy012345678Comment: Those who think Sanders could not win have to remember what happened with Trump. When Trump entered the primary, he was widely ridiculed as a complete non-starter that nobody would take seriously. He ran neck and neck with, and barely squeaked by wins over republican candidates. He was universally hated to the point where many candidates dropped out and endorsed Ted Cruz - a man that is universally hated by both parties. John Boehner called him 'the most miserable son of a bitch I've ever met in my life'.

After Trump barely squeaked by a win in the primaries, he goes against a historically unpopular Hillary Clinton, and is widely ridiculed as a complete nutjob. He barely squeaks by a win, losing the popular vote by millions, but winning key states by hair-thin margins.

People forget how he couldn't win pro-life voters because he had a long history of pro-choice statements, he couldn't win republican voters because he voted and donated extensively to democrats (even Hillary Clinton previously), he couldn't win the religious vote because he knew nothing about Christianity and was an adulterer and committed numerous crimes, he couldn't win the business person vote because he was a failure in business, etc... Trump could not win any segment of the vote according to popular opinion - yet he won them all because although they didn't like him, they sure as hell weren't going to vote for the other person.

It was the first election in recent US history (maybe ever) where the majority of voters for each candidate did not vote FOR their candidate - they just hated the other candidate more and voted AGAINST their most hated candidate.

Fast forward to 2025 and he is the undisputed face of the republican party and republicans are more solidly voting together and unified under him than under any other republican president perhaps in history. His power is absolute with nobody daring to step out of line for fear of instant career suicide.

I have yet to hear an explanation for why Trump could pull this off but Sanders could not, for all the same reasons.

Through his constant media pressure, he has now shifted the country so far to the right that I literally am debating friends and family members on whether democracy is preferable or not to a Trump dictatorship (I'm serious, I've had this exact talk a couple times already). This would have been unthinkable in 2015.

8 : Vindex94Comment: 2016 Bernie winning is a huge what-if. He wins and becomes the de facto leader of the Democratic party. They would be forced to adapt, and Progressives all over would be encouraged to run against uncooperative Dems and obstructionist Republicans. If he doesn’t get his agenda in the first 2 years, he mobilizes to get a more progressive congress to move through policies that would be immensely popular. Does 2016 loser Trump still try to cry foul about election results? He distracts the Republican base and those in power probably flounder around trying to figure out where to go from here. Bernie actually wants to make change and doesn’t care about corporate interests. He also gets to put in at least 2 Supreme Court justices, and that’s presuming Kennedy waits it out instead of retiring. He also makes extremely better choices with COVID, but the economy probably does take a hit in a similar way and he loses in 2020 unless the Republicans put up a dud. We are wayyyyy better off regardless of the 2020 results.

As for 2020? Very hard to tell. Bernie was likely even more popular then than he was in 2016. He has semblances of a progressive bloc in congress and gets to work straight away to undo the damage of Trump. One of his big weaknesses is he likes to play nice with his opponents, so he likely wouldn’t do any more than Biden did for trying to hold Trump accountable to his crimes. I think he’d be a more effective president than Biden just because he has further convictions while Biden mostly just wanted to return to pre-2016. Presuming the presidency doesn’t erode his health too much, he should be able to maintain his vigor but he likely opts to not run in 2024 and either endorses a candidate early or lets the primaries run their course. Biden was “return to normal” while Bernie would have done more to actually excite people. 

Either way, I do see how you could think he’d be stonewalled but a President who isn’t owned by corporate interests should be able to maintain high levels of popularity. He definitely wouldn’t be able to do everything he wanted in one term, but his presidency would define a generation of American politics.

9 : Calming_EmergencyComment: Disagree. Sanders lost because his policies and beliefs were not popular. If he won, that would mean a dramatic shift in sentiment, Sander has the same cult following as Trump. They are both protectionist and speak to the popukist movement that is overtaking the country. 

If Sanders won he wouod maintain a base level of fervant support which would help him implement slightly reduced extreme policies.
--------------------
--------------------
10 : rollemComment: While I largely agree with you, I think one thing to consider is that in a world where Sanders was at the top of the ticket, more young and progressive voters could've turned out, which could've given him a majority in Congress. 

These historical what ifs are tough though. He lost both primaries where the winner won an outright majority of primary voters. So I generally don't buy the narrative that either primary was stolen from him. If voters wanted him, they could've voted for him. And how influential could any DNC prefertial treatment be if that same treatment was so ineffective at other times? I just don't buy it and I think a majority of voters do not share their views on Reddit forums, so it's easy to see an innacurate snapshot of the zeitgeist online.

14 : Anomalous-Materials8Comment: Any possibility of him being president ended in 2015 when he was unable to stop Black Lives Matter activists from taking over the mic at one of his rallies.

However, you're assuming Sanders would be popular enough to win the electoral vote, but not so popular his supporters wouldn't blame congress for holding everything up. I don't know that I agree there. We'd see through the corporate interests holding back his agenda. 

  
I also think the 3 months of interm senator before a special election would confirm a democrat wouldn't be that impactful. But overall yes he would be stonewalled

18 : Unhappy_Heat_7148Comment: We have no idea what would happen if Sanders became the Democratic nominee and won in either 2016 or 2020. It's hard to argue with a what-if scenario. What would it take to change your view?

There are a few things we can say. If Sanders won the nomination either time, we're left with a lot of potential situations that could play out. However, if we're starting from the point that he wins the Presidency, that would mean that there would have been a groundswell of support for him that didn't come out in the primaries. We're talking about the political landscape changing like it did when Trump won in 2016. 

This means that the makeup of the House and Senate would likely be different or the environment would at least. 

In the Senate in 2016, we'd have to assume that Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have Dems winning instead of Republicans in their races. Both were considered toss ups at the time. In the Senate in 2020, we could have had races in Iowa and North Carolina shift Dem. But it's all speculation and the only thing we could go off of is that Bernie becoming the nominee in either election and winning would mean he has a lot more support than he did in those primaries. 

It's kind of hard to engage with this because it's more fan fiction than based on anything we can really discuss. A lot of things can happen without any evidence. Using what happened after an event that is drastically altered does not work well. 

What if Bernie remains very popular in office despite resistance from members of Congress? What if his popularity and his use of the Presidency leads to pressure on politicians to cave? 

We could easily say that in a world where Bernie has the momentum and support to win, he is operating with a less hostile climate.

22 : Taco_paradeComment: The part your missing is that had he won his progressive agenda would then have been pushed at all. Regardless of its success it would have forced politicians to have to actually then fight against it. Which would require the Dems to have to come out and bbe against the policies they claim to advocate for. 

Even for Republicans it would be a hard fight as most ideas like, ending wars, universal healthcare, and better education are extremely popular. It would not be a good look. 

Unfortunately Dems are held to the same masters as Republicans. Same donors both sides, just can't get a red suit in California so they have them out on a blue one. They forced Bernie out in order to avoid having to pull off that veneer.

--------------------
24 : pierogieman5Comment: This short term focus on "only talk about trying to do stuff you can currently accomplish" is killing the Democratic party's future stone dead. Republicans don't operate like this. It's an asinine way to sustain a political movement that keeps us constantly on the back foot in terms of messaging. You NEED to tell people what you're trying to do and campaign for those things for years, then use every lever and every tactic to get as much done as possible. Then blame and attack the other guys for getting in the way, which is then clearly true for all to see. If you're constantly reacting to your political landscape instead of creating it, you SUCK at politics. This attitude is typical of Democratic consultants, advisors, and established lawmakers, and it's ass backwards and killing the party's popularity with voters because no one thinks we have an agenda... which leaves the door open for Republicans to make up their own narrative about what the dems are doing. 




This is why Gavin Newsome is a dumbass. Dems fail to establish an agenda and a brand, kill their own populist wing, and what happens? Republicans fill the void with culture war bullshit and fearmongering about everything from trans people in sports, to non-existent crime waves, to demonizing student protestors. What's the worst possible way to respond to this? Well, that would be to let the far right CONTINUE to dominate the conversation by only engaging with their issues, and on their terms. That's what the idiots at the DNC and Newsome are trying to do. They fail to build their own narratives or bring up their own issues, and instead start pandering to the right wing side of the wedge. These are wedge issues. They are politically engineered to split your opposition off from the majority position of the general public and start a fight that they know they can win.... because they chose the battlefield strategically. That's why the media narrative talks about trans sports and chips away at rights and basic decency for marginalized folks, instead of attacking them directly in wats there's less support for.




 Pandering to majority opinion DOES NOT WORK as a response to this. It's bait. If you do that, you only fuel the perception that it's a big deal and validate the wedge attack on your own faction. You are never going to BEAT the right at being a dick to trans people or immigrants. If you play their game, you lose. That's THEIR game, and their rules. You have to do the hard work of actually building your own agenda and promoting it, preferably demonizing all the evil things the other guys are doing in the process. Tax the rich, fuck abusive landlords and private equity price gouging, end wasteful and destructive private health insurance by letting everyone use Medicare, build some decent fucking infrastructure again off the revenue of taxing greedy fucks in banking, and everything else the average Joe can get worked up to support. This is why you need people like Bernie Sanders or AOC leading the party; not because they will instantly achieve all of their goals, but because the party dies without having a strong public campaign to accomplish them.

25 : rektdatComment: So are you saying we may as well have had Clinton and Biden anyways? Bad argument
--------------------
--------------------
26 : FractalWitchComment: Okay. Here's the thing: For Sanders to have been elected, it would likely mean that the political landscape as a whole would need to have shifted. Your argument for it to stand pretty much wholly requires that literally every single variable that's been in place during both 2016 and 2020 would remain the same. The only difference would have been Sanders which is at it's core the issue in the reasoning you're trying to propose.

Sanders is far more progressive than any other potential presidential candidate that we have had. While Obama was very good at being highly charismatic, he was still extremely moderate and therefore did not really require anything to ultimately change in how the system works at large. His election was more of a social victory for progress because he's Black but not an actual *political* progress because many of his policies ultimately didn't push for nor require the system to move further to the left than the Democratic party finds comfortable.

The issue with Sanders and why he keeps bumping up against walls is because he would represent actual *political* progress - i.e. the system as *a whole* would need to shift more to the left and THAT in and of itself is difficult and ultimately why he hasn't been able to enact any of his larger policies.

Because of that, I'd argue that in the alternate reality where Sanders is elected, a lot of his policies *would* be possible because we likely would have seen a more progressive/left-leaning shift on a whole in terms of how every other branch of government is stacked, allowing him to - at the absolutely very least - be able to make *some* of his promises possible like M4A.

He's not just a perceived threat to Republicans/The Right, he's also a threat to the Democrats because they aren't actually that progressive and a lot of their strength (as they perceive it) comes from playing it safe by remaining in the middle ground and that's it.

At the end of the day, Sanders being elected is more reflective of an idealized step forward politically which is hard to see manifest in reality because of just how many things he has to fight against to make that happen. But it's that very same reality that we're in that would never allow him to be elected, so his ability *to* be elected would heavily imply that many variables as we know it would have shifted in his favor for that to be possible to begin with.

28 : TimmyTimeifyComment: If Bernie won in 2016 versus Hillary, he would have fucking destroyed Trump. Every heads up poll in 2016 had Bernie up by 20 points against Trump. He would have also flipped the senate and the house to a point where he would have had a mandate to do a lot of the concepts he had envisioned. 

If Bernie won in 2020, the prevailing headwinds of COVID would have been too much for any president to overcome. Inflation was a global phenomenon.

29 : hekateanservantComment: All republican stonewalling can be avoided by declaring them enemies of the people and removing them from power. Call the base into the streets to enforce the removal of fascists across the country, from the corrupt sheriff in a small town to the traitors in congress. 

America is ready for Maoist intervention, it will be incredibly popular once the public starts to see untouchable oligarchs chained up and stripped of the wealth they’ve stolen. Trump’s entire shtick is only possible because people want justice and he promised it to them…which was obviously a lie because he’s one of those fascist oligarchs himself but the point is that the lie he needed to tell to be popular is the very thing that socialists want to fulfill.

31 : KeyEnvironmental9743Comment: Sanders would not have struggled physically or mentally as much as Biden did. He recovered from his heart attack pretty well. Biden sounded terrible even when he was running in 2019.

I agree that his ability to get legislation through would be severely hampered, but his main obstacle would be the Democrats. They’ve been kneecapping their own left flank ever since they kicked Henry Wallace off FDR’s ticket in 1944, and that instinct would go into overdrive with President Sanders.

Now, you could overcome Congressional hurdles by using the bully pulpit inherent to being President, not to mention a rabid fanbase (which spans large swaths the country if that 2020 donation map is anything to go off of), to intimidate reluctant Congressman to support your legislation lest they get primaried. But Bernie simply did not have that instinct in him. The same weakness that haunted him during both of his campaigns would continue to haunt him in the Oval Office.
--------------------

32 : GravbarComment: The idea is to pick someone with enough momentum that the other party doesn't have a majority in either house. If Sanders had the senate and house, Republicans wouldn't be able to stone wall him on everything.

You see it with the mealy-mouthedness on us supplying an ethnic cleansing. You even saw it during the campaign where railed against The Evils® but stopped short of naming names and pointing fingers. 

The guy craves the approval of his work buds more than he does change. In the end, righties and centrists would have continued to detest him AND his support from the left would have eroded due to him pivoting center. Kinda like now

47 : litbiscuit69Comment: On the subject of his health, you bring up Sanders having a heart attack (a myocardial infarction or MI). As a nurse with ICU and cardiac rehab experience, caring for patients with MIs is not what the public thinks it is. Yes it can be deadly if left untreated, but generally with a timely response it is a quick trip to the cath lab and a one night stay on a telemetry floor. They are discharged the next day and typically these patients never even see the ICU. They follow up with a routine cardiology appointment for further management of course but that’s pretty much it. 

Aside from that, Biden’s physical health was never really what worried me. He’s pretty on par physically for a man his age, but his cognitive health was in horrible decline, and for the whole world to see. It seemed like it was very much a struggle for him to string together sentences that were coherent and on topic. Cognitively I wouldn’t trust him to manage a McDonald’s let alone an entire country. Sanders on the other hand appeared on Theo Vonn’s podcast on Aug 13, 2024 (this is the last time I think he’s appeared in a long form interview), and you can very easily tell by just listening to him that he is still very much sharp and cognitively intact at 83 years old. Listening to it then and listening to parts of it again, it is very clear he has a massive leg up on Biden cognitively at their ages.

The purpose of this was to draw an angry and disorganized reactionary protest. The TV images of violent actors and leftist incorpting a grab bag of other causes stiffens right wing resolve, pushes away people sitting on the fence, and gives the administration leeway to crack down harder with some measure of support.

In order to stop these aggressive, and oppresive, federal actions, people who are against them must organize, tighten up messaging, and present themselves in a way that either changes views or at the very least causes people to distance themselves and not actively support these policies. This worked for the civil rights movement in the 50s and 60s. 

The goal must not be to maintain some form of ideological purity or merely to give voice to grievance. Doing that will only further enable the administration. The faster things escalate, the more the administration gets what it wants.

3 : Bourbon-DecayComment: Will the Trump administration use the actions in LA to seize more power? Of course. If these protest actions didn't happen, would the Trump administration continue to seize more power? Of course. Fascists will use every avenue available to them to increase their hold on the reins of the state. If they don't have a justification they will make one up. The approval given to ICE to start this mass deportation program is based on a lie. 

Much of this is very new, and I⚡️⚡️E's newly expanded powers are just now becoming public knowledge as they ramp up their fascist program. Angelinos and other Americans can take the strategy of sitting back, strategizing, establishing messaging, and organizing a coherent and unified response. Meanwhile, Trump and his fascist stooges will have illegally deported hundreds of thousands immigrants (and citizens). 

Developing a long-term strategy is necessary, but it doesn't stop the injustices happening today. Trump's strategy is to overwhelm democratic institutions, and to rapid-fire dozens of new programs of cruelty in order to crush opposition. They want us to spend months strategizing and organizing against them, because when we finally create a strategy they will have moved fast beyond it, rendering it useless. That's why the Democrats are so useless right now. They are working on their messaging, they are developing strategies, and they are useless. 

You can't sit around and try to organize a national response to fascism because it will always keep you reacting instead of acting. Instead, we should be encouraging all denizens of the targeted urban centers to fight back. We must smash as much power as we can now because letting it grow will be that much harder in the future. Americans should see that their fellow Americans are rising up against a tyrannical government, they should see that they have agency and the ability to change things and fight against fascism. Without that, it is easy to feel helpless and isolated. It is easy to think maybe you are the only one that feels this way and therefore, maybe you are overreacting. 

Fascists will do what they want and find justification for their actions no matter what. The only way to that *right now* is to fight back. It is to show that they don't have the consent of the American people. They don't need protests in L.A. to deploy the National Guard, they were already developing plans for it before this week. They have been calling it an invasion since last year, and they did it to eventually enact martial law no matter how Americans responded. If Angelinos didn't fight back, the fascists would find another way to crackdown on dissent.

It is foolish to wait and fight the fascists when they are at their most powerful, we must do it now to create barriers to becoming that powerful.

ETA: The civil rights movement wasn't entirely peaceful. In fact, the threat of violence is what contributed to the gains of the movement. If they state didn't allow for MLK's peaceful resistance movement, they would have to contend with Malcolm X's. There is an emphasis on peaceful protest in American history education because they want you to think that is the best path. They want you to comply in advance

8 : imveryembarrassedhComment: You don't know history if you think that's how the civil rights movement succeeded. People back then were telling the protesters to just be quiet and recite the rhetoric that you're saying in this post. It took the sacrifices &amp; pain of thousands of people to make even the minimum of what we have right now happen.

Many, many people did things the more sympathetic &amp; "acceptable" way by silently sitting inside whites only restaurants or sitting in front of the bus and they still were brutally beat on, had dogs sicced on them, jailed, &amp; more. The majority of civil rights group leaders were assassinated whether they were peaceful or not. 

Learn about worker's rights, women's rights, and how other countries fought fascist regimes. None of it is perfect &amp; nice.

This was going to be manufactured regardless of action because the administration is the one in absolute power. It's incredibly difficult to adjust messaging when the media is complicit in condemning some while ignoring others (compare this with January 6 for what I mean). You have to understand "giving better messaging" is not a choice or option, it is often a privilege given to those who have control. The only option we have is to condemn this ourselves everyday and to stick together ❤️.

13 : Km15uComment: &gt;plays into the administration's hands and people against this need to slow down and strategize in order to win.

The opposite, the point of protest is to provoke an outsized response, the more violent trump gets the more likely people on the fence change sides. You saw it with BLM. Yes there's a backlash, but thats not who you're trying to reach anyway. The more disruption to society the harder it is to do bussiness and the more business leaders and the others who run the country start to demand changes just to keep the peace. 

A rebellion needs about 2.5% of the population engaged to succeed thats what protests like that seek to do.

4) &gt;&gt;The faster things escalate, the more the administration gets what it wants.

so then quit lighting things on fire, looting businesses, and throwing rocks at cops

16 : Signal_Opposite9161Comment: It’s actually just the left doing what they usually do. Protests and violence. You seem like you’re blaming the administration for doing exactly what it said it would do, and ignoring those causing violence because they lost an election, like they generally do on that side.
--------------------
--------------------
17 : sartrerianComment: I think it should be pretty clear to everyone that the administration is gunning for a confrontation regardless of any response they receive. They are exploring ways to defund an entire state out of spite. There is no response that halts, slows, or impedes their efforts. They ignore legal rulings, subvert the constitutional order at every turn. Without this impetus, they’d invent another. It’s moot. 

As to whether this justifies the terror the administration seeks to inflict to the silent majority, hard to say. Trump’s numbers are going way down, his lawmakers are increasingly spooked, and the instability (and especially the tariffs) are driving wedges into his coalition you can drive a bus through. These fractures will continue to degrade their legitimacy.

Lastly, the resources he’s burning through to power this hate movement are all the soft virtues of the nation: the trust in legitimate and sober leadership that undergirds our credit rating, our occasional commitment to our values that makes our international soft power, and the pluralistic procrustean bed of creativity and freedom that power our global economic and cultural reach. 

He has shown he will burn up every last good thing about this place to get a single additional knee to bend. 

So why not protest? Why not fight? Why not do every single thing in your power to take this where it’s going now?

Deny the Oligarch

18 : Ok-Comfort9049Comment: I think one of your premises is off- your CMV seems to assume that the majority if American voters oppose deporting illegal aliens.  A CNN poll a few months ago found that 57% of American voters support deporting all illegal aliens.  The goal of the violent protests is to disrupt law enforcement officers.  The goal is not to win over American voters who support the actions of the law enforcement officers.

I believe the goal of the protests is to use violence and the threat of violence to oppose the will of the majority of Americans.  In 1930s Germany the Brownshirts used political violence to suppress people who spoke out against their ideology.  In 1930s Italy Mussolini used 'combat bands' to suppress people who spoke out against his ideology.  The 'protests' that firebomb Tesla dealerships, scratch swastikas onto Teslas, and throw rocks at police and ICE vehicles are violent pro-fascist paramilitary forces.  They are not trying to win support, they are using violence to oppose the federal government.

20 : 112322755935Comment: The Civil Rights movement of the 40s-60s was unpopular with White Americans. Polling existed at the time and we know how the moment was viewed.

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/10/how-public-attitudes-toward-martin-luther-king-jr-have-changed-since-the-1960s/ Public opinions of MLK from 1960s to today | Pew Research Center

Most mass movements are unpopular when they are happening. The thing we need to understand is that there’s never going to be a way to fight conservatism that will be generally popular from the beginning. Societies don’t like change and forcing them to share power with groups they consider beneath them will only ever be generally supported by the group out of power. Every positive change we’ve ever had has required a massive amount of sacrifice from communities on the front line and only becomes popular in memory.

22 : entity330Comment: This will sound terrible.... Preamble: I am not a Democrat.

I think Democrats need to escalate. Trump has been showing his true colors for years. We aren't going to make it 2 years of this. We (everyone, not just Democrats) need to force Congress to act on constitutional violations instead of cutting taxes for billionaires while dismantling the country. If the GOP wants to keep blindly following Trump, we (everyone) should keep pushing the issue.

You say Democrats need to organize to win. This isn't a baseball game. The people protesting likely don't identify as Democrats when they got protest. They are protecting their neighbors from government overreach. To them this isn't about their team. It's about their community. And that's the fundamental problem with the GOP right now. They care more about winning than people they are stepping on. GOP voters care more about winning even if it means stripping their healthcare and social security.

23 : Dare_Ask_67Comment: Okay, they were not arrested yesterday people but  criminals.  A few Democratic politicians denounced it as arrested illegals, not as criminals. Word spread fast in the news called on. It was not the only place to just what's happening is it's happening in a lot of places from coast to coast.  The differences it was california. California thinks that it's better than the rest of the United States and that it should tell the rest of the United States how to live. It should not. The majority of states are tired of illegals and criminals. Right now they're just rounding up criminals.  


My opinion is anyone that is caught destroying private property and rioting instead of just protesting. In other words breaking the law, should be arrested charged and prosecuted. By the way if they are, you know they lose their right to vote. That may make a big difference in california. Because right now it's only the major cities that are democratic cities the rest of the countryside and Northern California are predominantly Republicans. Think about it

What surprises me frankly....such public abductions. Tactically, I would think quick, quiet would be a better straj for ICE. How about at night, at their house? They gotta go to the market or to work. Some of the video you see on tv, the protesters are already gathered?  Not smart.

25 : Cassius_RexComment: Your words will fall on deaf ears. Modern Protests are emotional things, basically venting about issues you have no personal control over. 

In many ways, modern Protests that get out of hand tend to hurt rather than help their causes. The LA protests aren't doing anything but strengthening the MAGAs in the lead up to the mid term elections. They get to say "see, that's who the left is, throwing rocks and waving foreign  flags".  

The aftermath of this could be losing the opportunity to take back of Congress (thus at least blunting the Orange wannabe Kim jung Il) as all it will do is encourage the MAGAs to vote even more.

And you can convince people they are being stupid, which means that in a way we deserve the Orange Dictator....

26 : MeanestGooseComment: I think you should start organizing better protests if you really think you know what would be more effective. 

The Administration doesn't need an excuse or cover. They do whatever they want. Quit blaming leftists and progressives and Democrats for the bad behavior of fascists and bigots. 

And I'd love to see evidence that if progressives are stoic and calm and dress in a nice polo shirt and khakis that there is a sizable group of people that would switch their allegiance from fascism to demand democratic norms. I hear variations of this claim a lot (like more people would vote Democratic if Democrats weren't mean) but it's Republican politicians I see insulting the disabled and the poor and minorities.

27 : MaddMethodComment: This country is just so full of cowards. If peaceful protest worked there’d never be riots. Trump has used violence on peaceful protesters just like he’s doing now. They enacted laws that allowed people to run over protesters legally, protected cops that have killed innocents, pardoned people who murdered said cops on January 6th and paid the survivors of one of the perpetrators millions even though she got what she deserved, constantly demonized minorities leading to violence against them from their constituents, encouraged violence against queer people. And you people want us to be cordial with them? Name one fucking time in history where being nice to fascist regimes led to good outcomes.

28 : [deleted]Comment: These "protests" only make illegal immigrants and the left look like animals. This would be labeled the June insurrection if these were Conservatives. Not assign myself a side, but vandalism and riots are not a good look, felt the same with Jan 6 regardless of causation. If you can't confront these issues with genuine poise and intellect, you're hurting your cause. MLK exemplified this 60 years ago, he did more in marches and speeches than any riot could ever do, IE the reputation of people like Malcom X.

29 : Front-Cut-4283Comment: They’re just proving Trump right. If they could stop rioting and stop this insurrection and just be law abiding people no one would care about a peaceful protest. But this isn’t a peaceful protest it’s a riot. They already burned down a lot of the state last year. Don’t need to burn down anymore. This type of thing is why businesses and people are leaving California. It’s become very unsafe. Can’t even go about your day without worrying about people destroying other peoples property or burning everything down. If they could be peaceful the government wouldn’t have to have the national guard step up. If they had competent police officers this would’ve never been escalated beyond a peaceful protest. If you want to destroy the country or burn it down just leave the country it’s that simple. How could people with so much hate for the US stay here when they’ve been given the opportunity to leave on their own by trumps administration.

Come into our country the right way and be a productive citizen, not a destructive one. Take your country's flags and go back if it was so good there where you came from. I don't understand why it's so hard to understand the difference between illegal immigration and legal immigration. Legal, you do have rights here. Illegal you don't! It's really simple. Don't bring the mess and behavior from your country and expect to be greeted with open arms here in America. Focus on getting legal citizenship! Then you can have a say.

54 : Least_Key1594Comment: I have a single challenge.

"This worked for the civil rights movement in the 50s and 60s."

Did it? By the end, MLK had become more radical in his speeches and thought, and they still killed him. White people, especially, w[ere majority-against him and Civil Rights](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/10/how-public-attitudes-toward-martin-luther-king-jr-have-changed-since-the-1960s/#:~:text=King%20was%20assassinated%20in%20April,a%20favorable%20opinion%20of%20him) for years after his murder. 

That is of course also erodes the effect of groups like the Black Panther Party, which understood the value of shows-of-force. 

In fact, I ask simply. What major movement won success with absolutely no violence? Because what you are saying, has been said by the right and centrists on every single movement, the same ones I'd imagine you'd currently say were Good and Needed to Happen.

Theres a line, I'm unsure who said it, but A Liberal is someone who is for every civil rights issue, except the current ones, and against every war, except the current one. I mention this because you utilized the word leftist in your description, which that paired with your stance makes me think you aren't one, even if you agree with some of what they do. 

  
A White-Washed, Sanitized History is not an honest one. Radical movements, yes even the violent aspects, were always a part of the history of movements. Good and Bad. 

  
Also, strict adherence to non-violence is inherently ideological purity, so you are failing your own stance that that must not be the goal.

  
Final Note, the peaceful option was when we said Abolish ICE. I do not think it is hard to guess where you stood on that statement.

You cheer when assets of a company are burned and destroyed, or people who use their products are attacked and harassed (Tesla and Tesla owners). 

This is who you are and why federal charges need to be brought to bear no only on the violent rioters and terrorists but against the elected officials in these states for violating the civil rights of their constituents.  No one should be held hostage by a violent minority.

Ah...but the Democrats have the literal tiger by the tail, do they not?  They've courted the radical left for support for years, and now cannot do anything about it and restore some sanity to their party.  If they do, they lose those votes and will lose even more elections.  There is a reason why the Democrat party is at the lowest ever in public opinion.

I can understand why: the main reason these countries were even partitioned was on religious grounds. However, as we have seen in the decades since, India has had good relations with several Muslim-majority nations, such as Bangladesh, Maldives and the Middle-Eastern countries. Both countries have close ties to the United Kingdom, their former coloniser.

I think that the issue of the princely states was the core reason for the wars between India and Pakistan.

By the time India and Pakistan gained their independence, they were functioning nations with heavily armed militaries and politically mobilised populations. To add to that, the political elite in both nations saw the princely states as antiquated entities. Giving them the ability to choose to whom they would accede was an added layer on this recipe for disaster.

One example of such a curious case is that of Jodhpur, which, despite having a Hindu ruler and Hindu population, considered joining Pakistan in exchange for access to ports and grain. The legal obscurity around this and the ignoring of the geopolitical reality of the two independent nations eventually caused the Junagadh situation and finally the issue in Kashmir, which led to the first war between the two independent nations.

While I think partition was unavailable by mid-1947, had the proposed borders also included the princely states, the new states could have had a more friendly relationship. In this proposal, princely states that were contiguous to the newly created states should have been partitioned as Hindu-majority and Muslim-majority territories, similar to how Bengal and Punjab were partitioned. (Hence, Hyderabad and Junagadh would have naturally joined India, Kalat would have joined Pakistan, and Jammu and Kashmir would be partitioned between India and Pakistan based on their Hindu and Muslim populations.)

This clarity would not help the millions of people who were displaced due to partition and would not avoid the humanitarian crisis, but it would ensure there would be no war in the upcoming years, and perhaps could have led to a peaceful South Asian bloc as well.

2 : Thoth_the_5th_of_ThoComment: If the princely states land disputes were the cause of tension, this would have been over decades ago. Border skirmisher rarely get this heated. In general, I try to sound neutral, but it's hard to in this case. Pakistan intentionally made itself a safe haven for islamists from very near its founding. They where a crucial part in the rise of political islam in the Middle East. India has decent relations with other muslim states because few others are as bad as Pakistan. They make Saudi Arabia look like Norway. The root of the tension has always been Pakistan's islamism.

3 : barthiebarthComment: Pakistan and India got off on the wrong foot because of the atrocities during partition.


Kashmir was the immediate cause of their first (and subsequent) conflict. However, in your alternative history partition is still messy and the enmity between the two new states would still exist.


Maybe there would be some other place where the two states clash. Or maybe there would be no direct conflict, but a cold war. In real life the two states went to blows over Bangladesh in the 70s, which was a conflict that had no (direct) relationship to Kashmir.

After seeing today’s scenario and reading history. I feel like society does not evolve in straight lines or steady gradients. It does not evolve through equilibrium. At its core swings a great pendulum, arcing between extremes: patriarchy and feminism, liberalism and conservatism, authority and dissent and collectivism and individualism. These are not just ideological opposites; they are engines of movement. This constant tension, rather than harmony, is what keeps the machinery of social life in motion.

Each swing is a response, a recoil from excess. When one ideology dominates too long, it becomes rigid, complacent, or unjust. The pendulum swings away—not out of malice, but necessity. Like for example, Feminism did not emerge randomly. Feminism rises from patriarchal overreach and centuries of patriarchal dominance. Then in Markets, they loosen when state control strangles initiative. The Conservatism gathers force when liberal progress uproots foundations too much. Each arc is a course correction, though rarely gentle. The swing from one end to the other may feel like regression or revolution.

In economics, this pattern is just as visible. Booms and busts, deregulation and re-regulation, austerity and stimulus—these shifts mirror social mood. When trust in individual freedom is high, markets are loosened. When collective fear sets in, states intervene. When rich hoard too much wealth, society collapses a rebellion comes (to “eat the rich”) and wealth redistribution takes place.

Stability, then, is not the absence of extremes but their rhythm. The swing is not failure; it is function. And understanding society requires watching the arc—not longing for stasis. At each stage, one extreme—when left unchallenged—breeds its opposite. It’s not necessarily that one side “wins” permanently; rather, each extreme overshoots, triggering a corrective backlash.

Progress is not a march but a swing. And though each extreme may claim permanence, it is the rhythm between them that sustains the structure. The clock of society does not tick forward by holding still—it moves only because the pendulum swings.

**Of course, this is a broad framework—individual events and contexts often carry their own unique nuances that don’t fit neatly into a simple pendulum model. But understanding general patterns requires one to overlook nuances and outliers.**

1 : redTurnip123Comment: Things do often happen this way, but I don't think it's productive. People tend to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Like when men tired of out-of-control feminists gravitate towards Andrew Tate. Or those that think the solution to income inequality is a Marxist take over of the government. A lot of times the right correction is a 1° turn, be we do a 180. Yes, men should want women to be safe and have equal opportunity, and ideologues need to tone it down (or be toned down).

If it's the latter, that society is just generally 'moving' as in changing, without direction (thus, pointlessly?) that seems fairly self evident. If you want to say 'towards progress' that involves defining what progress means.

3 : carlcarlington2Comment: Nothing the us government has done since fdr could be considered "hard left" by any  honest perspective.

Funding fascist dictatorships is pretty hard right, has the us government ever supported communist revolutions?

The patriot act passed by conservatives is a very far right bill. Has the us government arrested any of the bankers responsible for the 2008 financial crash?

American politicians are actively discussing birth right citizenship. Does even senstor Sanders public call for the end of capitalism?

The things that are seen as leftist wins in modern years are pretty much factually all compromises.

Obamacare is a compromise for Medicare for all.

The pro-act is a compromise for guaranteeing union representation as a right.

Due to combination of legalized bribery, and gerrymandering the us government as squarely remained center to far right for the past few decades.

6 : Stunning_Market_3893Comment: I would agree to some extent.


It is not in the comfortable stasis that life propels itself. It is in the extreme heat of fire, and the channeling of this by forces, that the new forms take shape.


Stasis inherently leads to breaking down. In some instance slowly, in others quickly. To cling to things is not a state that can be adopted long term. The clinging or the drive for stasis is a force that acts in combination with the forces of Chaos or incessant change.


The two interact and the things that stick remain. The things that don't fade away. Every person has a function to play in this process. Some people personify the chaos. Others personify the force of order or stasis. Most flip flops between depending on the aspect or process.


That is the way of nature and all things. The issue is that now the natural process is being tainted. Things that are promoting end goals that illustrate some form of Utopian outcome are advocating stasis. Things like the end goal of feminism/communism/anarchism/conservatism or any of the isms, which are blind to the fact that when they achieve their goals, there will always be forces to challenge them. There is no sanctuary. No utopia. It is a dream and nothing more. Nothing is exempt from the forces of nature itself and it's processes.


Life never rests.

Democrats and Republicans often times don't correct each other and it seems a more evolved, nuanced strategy to have multiple political parties like they do in Europe, something for people to go between, instead of this "my side, your side" strategy that we have in the United States.

Could not agree more though that progress is not one direction, and it's important to have opposition since as we know, power corrupts.

You contradicted yourself.

The fact that there are "BOTH sides" shows that alternative viewpoints *are* accepted in society. For much of the pre-social media age, in many countries there was only *one* ideology you were allowed to believe in and that was the one the state blared on state-controlled radio and TV.

The internet and social media, being more anonymous and further from the grasp of government, helped diversify opinions from traditional media. "Gay people should have equal rights" is one of those opinions that flourished thanks to social media.

* **Day 1: The polite ask.** Princess shows up in regular clothes and asks (POLITELY) to join the Powerpuff Girls. The girls huddle and give a unanimous, civil “sorry, no.” Blossom does the talking; Buttercup mostly scowls.
* **Day 2: Double meltdown.**
   1. Princess returns in a knock-off Powerpuff costume. The instant Buttercup sees it she squares up, fists cocked, ready to swing.
   2. Minutes later, the Mayor calls about a bread-and-butter bank robbery. Princess tags along, totally botches the takedown, and nearly gets civilians hurt. Same day, second time, Buttercup steps in again—*still* itching to throw hands.
* **Day 3: Armor &amp; rag-dolling.** Princess, ego bruised beyond repair, rolls up in high-tech battle armor and starts trouble. Buttercup charges first…and gets rag-dolled across the Pokey Oaks schoolyard.

# Why I Put the Blame on Buttercup

1. **Opening posture = “No and fuck you for even asking.”** A kid in cosplay is not a capital-V villain. Buttercup’s Day-2 fury tells Princess the only path to respect is violence.
2. **Missed leadership moment.** The girls have mentored outsiders before—Bunny in “Twisted Sister,” Robin in “Superfriends.” Buttercup skips that playbook and jumps straight to intimidation.
3. **Self-fulfilling prophecy.** Treating Princess like an enemy before she’s broken a law practically writes her villain origin story.
4. **Total clash with the show’s moral; Blossom spells it out.** After Princess loses on Day 3, Blossom lays down *the* creed: Blossom embodies the series’ “heart first, fists second” ethos—while Buttercup spends two straight days modeling the reverse: **“Because you’re just a spoiled brat. And being a Powerpuff Girl isn’t about getting your way, or having the best stuff, or being popular or powerful. It’s about using your own unique abilities to help people and the world we all live in. And you, little girl, have done nothing worthy of the name ‘Powerpuff.’**”

# “Smarter” In-Universe Moves (Yes, They’d Make Boring TV)

* Keep the unanimous “no,” but match Blossom’s diplomacy instead of Buttercup’s brawl-energy.
* Lay out clear boundaries: “Train with the Professor, start with small rescues, *earn* the suit.”
* After the botched robbery, escort her home and loop in her dad, no punches necessary.

Sure, any of that would shrink an 11-minute cartoon to a 30-second PSA, but inside Townsville logic they’re smarter and way more on-brand.

Buttercup’s fists-first diplomacy took a brat and forged a nemesis. **Convince me it was the right call.**
--------------------
1 : XenoRyetComment: I don't think you can fairly equate scowling in response to such an absurd request as "No and fuck you for asking", so we're a little off base right out of the gate.

Two, even in instances where mentorship is appropriate, which this is not, that's Blossom's role, not Buttercup's.

Three, "look what you made me do" is never an appropriate excuse.  Morbuck is responsible for her own choices and actions, even if Buttercup was mean to her.

And not to put too find a point on it, but Morbucks *is* a spoiled brat who does not have a demeanor or personality suited to powerpuff work.  She is the one that escalated things at every turn, Buttercup was only ever reactive to those escalations.  She possibly could've reacted better, that's true, but primary responsibility still lies with Morbucks.  Had she taken the no for an answer, or even taken a half-second outside view of the situation, none of it would've happened.  Buttercup didn't create anything, Morbucks was a nemisis from the start.

To be clear, I'm not necessarily saying that organ ~~donations~~ sales **should** be illegal; arguments about why it should be legal aren't really going to change my mind here. I'm also not going to be persuaded by the "well there are plenty of other comparable, legal forms of risky, bodily exploitation under capitalism" argument - if that is the case, then we should be banning **more** things that meet our justification for preventing organ sales, not shrugging and allowing all forms of comparable exploitation. As an example, my arguments might suggest that paying for plasma or participating in medical trials should also be illegal - if the logic holds and they are morally comparable, then yes, those might need to be illegal for moral consistency.

The crux of the issue is that doesn't make any logical sense to me why every country in the world would ban selling almost all organs as commodities, but a handful of them (including my home in the US) allow women to be paid for the use of their reproductive organs to gestate and birth a child. In other words, the justifications for limiting commercial organ sales hold when applied to commercial surrogacy (if not more so), **so if one is illegal, then they both should be.** Why? Let's start with the basic arguments against the sale of organs.

1. **Removing an organ entails a significant life-threatening risk.** Any form of surgery exposes someone to the risk of infection, surgical complications, chronic health issues, and/or death. The risks may be relatively low, but it is absolutely the case that they could kill or severely harm you.
2. **The only time people should be allowed to take significant life-threatening risks is with their fully informed, free consent.** Look, I get it. There are all kinds of potentially dangerous things that people want to do for one reason or another, and we shouldn't just ban all of them. The general social principle we have adopted is that people are allowed to assess those risks and make a personal calculation about whether to accept them. However, this is predicated on them understanding what they are signing up for/possibly risking (being informed), being capable of making decisions to begin with (e.g. not being impaired or a child), and not predicated on coercion (e.g. a contract signed with a gun to my head is not a valid contract).
3. **The commercial sale of organs inevitably creates markets for those organs that pay the minimum amount possible for them.** This is usually the first and most obvious reason to ban the sale of organs. Given the risks of giving up an organ, people aren't going to do it unless they are compensated, and people with the means to afford an organ are going to find the amount of money that will induce someone to take that risk. This is no different from any other market - I want something I don't have and someone else does have it, but I have money they need, and so we make a deal. When we consider that getting an organ is literally a life-or-death necessity, it is perfectly reasonable to suspect that, absent regulation/bans, a for-profit market **will** emerge. The price of those organs will follow the pattern set in every other market - people with the supply will try to get as much money as possible, but the people with the demand only want to spend as much as they need to get it.
4. **The people willing to take the risks of organ donation in exchange for money are going to be desperate, which blurs their consent.** Most people aren't looking to give up an organ for a living. It's painful, difficult, incurs serious risks, and just isn't as appealing to people as other ways to earn money. The existence of a whole range of hazardous fields proves that people are willing to risk their health and safety if the price is "right" - there is a reason that the majority of miners and sex workers globally are drawn from the poorest sectors of society. Given an alternative, most people don't choose these physically risky jobs unless they have to due to necessity. When the "choice" is destitution/death or doing something you don't want to, people who select the latter are doing so out of coercion, which means they aren't freely consenting.  Moreover, the incentives for people to serve as middlemen within a market like sex work in order to profit themselves create situations where people have an incentive to claim their "worker" is consenting in order to continue to profit from a client who might hesitate if they knew someone was being forced. Pimping and sex trafficking is highly lucrative, and we have every reason to believe that middlemen would exist to connect organ buyers with organ sellers who might be consenting in order to make money for themselves, without taking on any of the physical risks.
5. **A system that allows for organ sales will further inequity in heal
--------------------
1 : WaterboysWaterboyComment: The difference imo is that is a lot more practical to kill someone and harvest their organs vs kidnap someone and use them as a surrogate for someone else. Essentially black market organ industry would be much more evasive and prominent than black market surrogate industry which would be more expensive and difficult to run than say a prostitution ring. And it would be harder to say whether they were given legitimately or not.
--------------------
--------------------
2 : orangutanDOTorgComment: It’s been decades but when I was in law school they taught us that the surrogacy isn’t an enforceable contract and the mother can always refuse to give up the baby, at least in the US, but then the people paying for the baby could sue for their costs back. But also the mother could sue the sperm contributor for child support. It seemed like a big mess but I never looked deeper into it than what I needed to pass the test.

3 : the_1st_inductionistComment: Isn’t your title a little inaccurate? Your argument seems more like selling your organs should be illegal, the same reasons that you have for that also apply to commercial surrogacy, so that should be illegal as well.

4 : theredmokahComment: Isn't the big difference that in organ sales/donations the organ is gone.

And although pregnancy cares a health toll for sure, provided that nothing goes wrong, the surrogate doesn't lose any part of her body.

Like a chicken laying an egg.
--------------------
--------------------
5 : RoadshellComment: Apologies if you went over this in the post, but it's quite long so I'm not reading all of it.  Organ sales are illegal because organs are potentially life saving items which shouldn't be reserved for those who can afford them.  Babies are many things but they're not that.  You can potentially live a long life without having children.  Additionally they're kind of a renewable resource.  Women can give birth to multiple children over the course of their lives but they cannot donate their kidneys multiple times.

7 : darwin2500Comment: The big difference is that surrogacy has opportunity costs.  

Most jobs cannot be worked throughout pregnancy, and most people purchasing surrogacy will not want you working past the first few months, if at all.

So you are trading in the money you could have made working that time for the money paid for surrogacy. And in fact, as we've seen from studies of the gender wage gap, a pregnancy often interrupts your career trajectory, leading to lower wages long-term.

So: whereas being allowed to sell organs could create competition that puts pressure on *all* poor people to donate and that drops the price of organs very low, there is a natural price floor on surrogacy since it trades off against wages. 

This limits the number of people for whom it makes sense to be a surrogate, limits how low the price can go, and eases the pressure on poor people to be surrogates, compared to what would happen with organ donation.

8 : shumcalComment: I'll attempt to slightly change your view by pointing out that your argument presupposes that commercial surrogacy is legal, while in actuality [most regions that have laws about surrogacy already ban it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy_laws_by_country#:~:text=In%20such%20conditions%2C%20the%20surrogacy,a%20child%E2%80%9D%20under%20international%20law.)

11 : BobbyFishesBassComment: One of my biggest moral issues with the sale of organs is that it inevitably result in the wealthy having access to organ transplants, while the poor are left to die. To me, that seems like a capitalist dystopia—healthcare should ideally be available equally to everyone, regardless of wealth. 

There are also practical issues. Commercial organ sales would create a large incentive to lie about the organs being sold, which could have severe consequences.

With commercial surrogacy, it’s not really healthcare in a traditional sense. People NEED organs or they will die. No one NEEDS a surrogate mother. So my main moral objection doesn’t really exist.

Practically, commercial surrogacy doesn’t seem to have any major issues. Not saying it’s perfect, but the benefits for freedom seem to outweigh the costs. 

I think you also greatly overstate the risks of childbirth. For a healthy mother with access to a high standard of healthcare, the risks of having a child are almost nil. 

TLDR: Organ sales would lead to organ transplants going to the highest bidder, which is a disturbing and obviously unacceptable outcome. Paid surrogates similarly go to the highest bidder, but this is much more acceptable for obvious reasons. Because of this, while the state absolutely has a strong interest in banning organ sales, individual freedoms outweigh the state’s interest in banning paid surrogate mothers.
--------------------
--------------------
12 : PuzzleheadedVideo649Comment: This is a women's issue. An issue of female bodily autonomy. If a woman wants to carry a child for someone else, then she should have the right to and because women are members of society, there should be systems in place funded by society to protect her from being exploited in the process. That's the surrogacy issue.

As to the commercialization of it... Men are allowed to sell semen. Women are allowed to sell eggs. Clearly the commercialization of reproduction is allowed in society. If you start saying women should not be allowed to carry a child to term for money, then you open a whole ethical can of worms. It could easily be avoided by investigating exploitation of surrogates and regulating the industry like every industry in history. 

And I do mean every industry. There is not a single mainstream industry that exists today that did not go through a period of widespread exploitation that was then heavily regulated to get to the point it is today. Just do that for surrogacy.
--------------------

13 : s_wipeComment: Hmm

I can see why its in the grayzone but

Thinking of it as Buying Vs renting a human.

Buying a human is a taboo now, today, slavery is a really big no - no.
Commercial Organ harvesting is on that line... Its ownership of humans and human lives.

Yet Renting a person for all sorts of jobs is perfectly acceptable , even if the job entails serious risk of bodily harm.
As long as enough safety precautions are met, renting a person for a risky job is perfectly acceptable.

I will compare commercial surrogacy to being an infantry soldier.

You are assigned this job based on your physicality ,you are deployed on a mission that takes several month.
Your life is at risk, you suffer uncomfortable scenarios, experience pain.
But its a job, and it pays well, and once you're done, you get to return back to normal life almost as though nothing happened.

14 : Calming_EmergencyComment: I think the main difference is that commercial surrogacy allows a level of prejudice that would preclude the class of people that makes organs sales unethical.

Can i ask you how you rationalise the existence of a being that is omniscient, had the idea of creating adolf hitler, saw that hitler would go to hell if created, chose to create hitler, knowing that hitler would go to hell and then happily sent hitler to hell when his time arrived, telling hitler that the blame was all on him despite the fact that he was the one who used his “omnipotence” to create a being that would go to hell? (Of course, all of this assumes hitler went to hell, but i'm really just talking about any single individual who ends up in hell, or destroyed by God, as i understand some christians don't believe in hell)

The only replies i’ve heard to this are things along the lines of "your free will is responsible for your destiny, not God". But this just undermines the foreknowledge God's omniscience gives him. If i hold a ball over a river and release it, then destroy the ball on the grounds that it chose to get wet, how is that any different from what most theistic religions are suggesting today?
Perhaps this would fly if we could just assume God were a wicked person by nature, but these religions define God as a fundamentally fair, loving, benevolent, merciful god who somehow still allows souls to suffer in hell for all eternity despite the fact that he orchestrated it all.

I did my research and found out that there are multiple theological stances that try to reconcile our free will and reward/punishment with God's "omni" qualities, but they never seem to be able to pair True Omniscience and True Omnipotence together and also always just sound like extreme speculation you'd hear from a star wars fan trying to explain what COULD be. Creating a huge and complex framework from very little to no evidence in the "original text" that supports said framework makes it feel like i'm just looking at writers desperately trying to fix plotholes somebody else created.

 Im not trying to mock anybody's belief system, this is something that genuinely disturbs me but wont be answered in real life because everyone around me will say “you are listening to the devil” when i ask them about it. I say this as somebody who has been raised by dogmatic west african christianity that immediately disparages any sort of inquisition as the voice of satan. And after living my whole life convinced that this God definitely existed and gave its world this meaning, these new perspectives are threatening to shatter all of that.

2 : AezoraComment: This is gonna go way beyond what reddit can do for you.

The question you are asking is known in philosophy as the problem of evil. Thousands of philosophers have debated this over millenia. There are many possible solutions, but whether you will find any of them acceptable really just depends on you. Your best bet is to go research this, find some philosophers who seem interesting and start reading. 

But ultimately I would say that many of the solutions are not contradictory messes, just not necessarily a solution you like. As a quick example, take the simple solution that God is simply beyond your understanding.

If you were a literal ant, and you walked onto a book of Shakespeare, you'd have no idea what words are, or stories, or books, or basically any concept contained within. Understanding who Shakespeare is or why he did what he did, or even what he actually did just isn't feasible for an ant. 

If God truly exists and is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, we would expect that he would act in ways that don't make sense to us. If he always made sense to us that would be weird. Heck, if he regularly made sense to us that would be odd. 

Most people don't like that solution since it doesn't feel very satisfying. But it's a logical, coherent argument.

ETA: I'm not directly advocating this argument or it's conclusion. It's an example. I'm not interested in debating it.

3 : Background_Lock8392Comment: So your main problem with the attributes of god is that you can't understand the pre destination and decree aspect.

Basically in Islam it's explained that your life, death, parents, gender, and birth are all already written by Allah. And these things are decided.

However these things can change. And that's through prayer. That's why miracles exist. Through prayer. You can change your own destiny by prayer.

As for the earlier example. In Islam it's clear that Allah almighty already knows your entire life and how it will play out. But Allah doesn't interfere himself. Not because he can't. Because he has given us free will. Yes our life is already written. But the point here is that you don't know what is written and what's not.

So you still are responsible for your own life. Yes it's already "determined". But the key thing here is that it's already known by god. And you in the present are still living it. Your choices matter. Your life matters.

For example hell my conversation with you can very much be written lmao. 

Now I have the option to reply to you. I can choose to do and not to do so. When I began writing this I intended to Post this. And if I do then it's a part of destiny. And what if I don't? Well I don't know what's written in my life. So it is very well that I didn't intend to post this.

It's confusing but still the Quran outright said that humans can never understand the concept of God no matter how hard we can try. We can never grasp his true nature.

You could create an AI friend— it’s easy. You can program it to obey your every whim and never question you. Or you could have an actual human child who could reject and disobey you or could choose to actually love you and who will surprise you and create things you never imagined. God made both jellyfish in the first camp and humans.

6 : GalaXion24Comment: One thing I'll point out is that Christianity is generally rationalistic. That is to say, it is very much assumed that God is rational and works in a logical manner and that his creation is logically consistent (and therefore can be studied and understood, hence science, but that's besides the point).

Another question asked about God's omnipotence is can God create a rock so heavy that even he couldn't lift it?

This sort of proposed Paradox can be argued to be playing with words and definitions and be nonsensical, rather than a real question. Omnipotence means God can do everything, but somethings are not real "things" for God to be doing.

We can construct sentences with words that aren't logical realities, such as "More people have gone to Germany than I have." which may seem like it would mean something at a glance, but it really doesn't. It's incoherent.

For something to be a real/potential thing, it must be something that is logically coherent.

From here we get to things like the problem of evil. I mean, why would God create cancer? But if God did create our universe and all its laws of physics, and create this world where everything seems to be able to run independently without his direct intervention, and we exist and can ourselves do things, might it not be that cancer is just an inevitability? All organisms seem to develop cancers, cells just do occasionally become damaged and get out of control.

But think about what it might take for them to never be damaged. What if cells never made errors when copying? Well that would imply no mutations, which would imply no evolution. It would be logically inconsistent to have one without the other. What if cells weren't impacted by things like radiation? Well, again, the radiation and the causing of chemical reactions by them are just a consequence of the laws of physics in general, you'd have to alter all of reality.

Can there be any logically coherent self-sustaining system which has no downsides at all? Is not any part or rule of this sandbox that is necessary or good also inevitably going to have consequences that might not be?

Can we have free will and yet have no one ever make a choice that is evil?

One might say the things you ask of God are what is contradictory.

7 : steamed_duckComment: The truth is that Christianity as a whole makes very little sense, is full of contradictions and is just quite dumb. Religion spreads through indoctrination, not free will. If you are struggling with your faith, try create your own belief system, such as just believing their is a all-powerful entity that created everything, not necessarily good. It makes far more sense to assume everything was created by a powerful entity and that it does not care about anything, than the Bible, which is full of rubbish.

8 : nitrodmrComment: Let's first address a couple of things. It's a common mistake to think hell is a place. Hell is not a place but rather the distance one deliberately puts themselves and God. When the soul passes over, they go to the place called land of the dead. It's a waste land. But due to translation errors, the English word they used is helheim. Over time it got shortened to be Hell. In the center of the wasteland is a city where heaven is. 

But God doesn't send people to hell. People through their own actions put distance between themselves and God because they don't want to be held accountable for their sins.

Also predestination is a common misconception. You can't have sin and predestination. What would be the point of sin if you were predetermined to do so. Predestination doesn't exist. Free will does exist and it's because free will exists that sin has meaning. When we sin, it's because we choose to. Some people may argue that we may not have the choice but they are incorrect. We can choose to do what is easy and what is right. Unfortunately life conditions us so sometimes we can't see that.

For example you chose Hitler as an example. God created life but he did not create people for predetermined roles. Unfortunately this is the result of living in a fallen world. Life wears us down and people choose bad choices. Hitler and others made terrible choices because they wanted to. 

The reason God doesn't stop them is because of free will. Also what would be the point of free will if God was going to police us for every bad choice we were making.  I believe you want a god that polices evil. But God doesn't want that. He wants his greatest creation to follow the path he sent to be perfect beings.

God's love is so deep that he wants us to find our own way and choose Him. That's the love of a father. The love of our Father.

11 : Particular-Star-504Comment: One view in Christianity specifically, is that God isn’t completely omnipotent, because of the Devil. The evil comes from Satan, not God directly (look at the book of Job for an example). But then given that evil exists, God has overcome it, and Jesus (who is God) has died and sacrificed himself, God does understand the problem unlike any other religion.

12 : AudienceSafe4899Comment: I wondt engage with you main question, but i would urge you to think about Hitler, and human development in general.


Hitler wasnt some one in a trillion, wasnt born different. He was pretty average actually. Hitler developed. All people mainly developed, there are very few traits where its just "oh they are born that way", Most people develope traits based on their sorroundings, and so did Hitler.
He wasnt born evil. A number of choices and Influenced made hin to become the evil mess He was.


Don't think about how much better you are than Hitler, think about how you can become the opposite of Hitler.

13 : honeydill2o4Comment: You think the a world without Hitler is better than a world with Hitler. This is not excusing the unimaginable atrocity of the Holocaust, but one could imagine a genocide ten times or a thousand times larger. 

How do you know that a genocide of 6 million wasn’t the only way to prevent a genocide of 6 billion later on? 

You might also believe that there *must* be a better way to prevent the worse genocide. However, it’s impossible to know unless you’re omnipotent.

14 : TangoJavaTJComment: I used to hold a similar view, but I don't anymore. Here's what changed it for me.

So yes, "pure" omnipotence in the most liberal sense of the word is self-contradictory. Can God create a stone so heavy that he can't lift it? If no, there's something he can't do, that being creating the stone. If yes, there's something he can't do, that being lifting the stone. QED.

I think there are two possible objections to this:

&gt; God can do contradictory things

God can create a stone so heavy he cannot lift it. He can also just lift it anyway. This seems weird, but we're talking about the divine creator of the universe here, so obviously he can do things that don't make sense to humans.

&gt; Contradictions are not things

God could make a triangle the size of the universe but he couldn't create a triangle with five sides because by definition that which has five sides is not a triangle. This trivially seems like a "thing" that God can't do, but contradictory things are meaningless. We may as well say that God is not omnipotent because he can't "florp wibble foo". That's not a thing that can be done because it's not a meaningful thing because it's incoherent.

On omniscience, a friend of mine explained God's omniscience as that God *can* know anything, not that he *does* know everything. If God does know everything then that is incompatible with free will, since if God knows which word I will end this sentence with before I finished writing it then I have no freedom to choose a different velociraptor. But if God *can* choose to know what I say before I say it but in practice doesn't, God is still omniscient and I am still free. 

If we have an extremely broad definition of words like "omniscience" and "omnipotence" then it does seem to be a paradox, but theologians have constructed models of how these things could work which still very much feel like omnipotence and omniscience but are not contradictory.
--------------------
--------------------
15 : KrytanComment: Why do you believe God is both omnipotent and omniscient? 

In the Bible, it talks about God sending out angels to find out what is going on. 

Even in the Lord's Prayer, it talks about how God's will not done on earth, but they pray that God's will might be done on earth, as it is currently in heaven. 

CS Lewis, one of the greatest Christian apologists, wrote an entire science fiction trilogy, positing that Earth is basically a rogue planet ruled by Satan, while all the other planets are still in their idyllic Eden state, because only humans 'ate the apple' and fell. Being ruled by Satan, it is a silent planet, none of the other planets communicate with it in any way. This was particularly interesting to me, because it's basically an answer to the 'Fermi Paradox' long  before the paradox was ever formally stated. 

I think lots of Christians believe God's will isn't being done on earth. I mean, there are entire books talking about how Satan rules earth and a big great last battle will be fought during which Satan's rule will be broken. See the book of Revelations. 

But even for those who think he is both omniscient and omnipotent, the concept of free will pretty easily answers the apparent contradiction.  God creates people and then gives them the free will to choose good or evil.  I don't see much point in trying to say things like "Well if God knew before hand that they would do xyz" because that's basically trying to rationalize the thoughts of people bound in time and apply them to a being unbound in time, which is in my opinion impossible. 

Some people act like God is just like us, a being locked in time moving forward, but one who happens to know everything in advance. But what if in fact he is a being to whom everything is happening all at once? 

Also: why are you upset that God punishes people who choose evil by sending them to Hell (when he knew ahead of time they would do so) but you aren't upset at God rewarding people who choose evil by sending them to Heaven (even though he knew ahead of time they would do so). Aren't both the same scenario, logically speaking?

TLDR: Saying "How can God be a loving God if he lets his creations make bad choices" is no different than saying "How can a loving parent give their children the freedom to make bad choices".

16 : Virtual_Technology_9Comment: God creates human beings and then gives us free will. 
Thus is it the fault of God giving us free will? 
Or the fault of us humans choosing to do evil and abide by what Satan wants us to do. 

This life is a test whether or not we worship God almighty or fall into Satan's trap. 

If you want justice the day of judgement will come and everyone will be accounted for. 
Evil Muslims will go to hell for many many years for their sins. Everyone will pay what they owed.

17 : kwantsu-dudesComment: Omniscient has NOTHING to do with knowing "the future". The future isn't anything. It doesn't exist, it hasn't  happened, and thus isn't even a concept of knowledge. "All knowing" refers to all there is to know. Simply all present, all informed. God exists outside of time, not within the time allowed to manipulate it and travel into the future to see things that haven't occured yet and then come back to the present to act on it. You're literally speaking of the paradox of time travel itself, not omniscience.

Omnipotent. God doesn't create people "who will go to hell". He creates entities with **the potential** to go to hell. Just as Satan himself rebelled against him. To be all powerful doesn't mean you need to control everything. Just as we have potential, so does God. But our power isn't defined by needing to act on something.

Hell is only "suffering" from the framework of God. You suffer in "hell" (simply not heaven), because you aren't  spending eternity with God. And that being away from God is described within the religion as a horrible place. Just as people call casinos, bars, and strip clubs horrible places where people suffer. Why do you think a non believer would feel like they were actually suffering? How do you imagine this "sufgering" in an afterlife without physical forms, the brain chemistry that exists only in our human physical form?

20 : omrixsComment: Have you ever heard of [apophatic theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology?wprov=sfti1#)? It’s basically the idea that God, the Divine, etc. are beyond human understanding so they can only be approached (e.g. described) by negation. 

As Maimonides — a rabbi, philosopher and doctor *inter alia* (as well as one of the most influential and important Jewish figures in history) — said in his book *Guide for the Perplexed* (1:58; from the Wikipedia article linked above): 

&gt; God's existence is absolute and it includes no composition and we comprehend only the fact that He exists, not His essence. Consequently it is a false assumption to hold that He has any positive [attribute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction?wprov=sfti1) [...] still less has He accidents (מקרה [my addition: better translated imo as “happenstance”]), which could be described by an attribute. Hence it is clear that He has no positive attribute however, the negative attributes are necessary to direct the mind to the truths which we must believe [...] When we say of this being, that it exists, we mean that its non-existence is impossible; it is living — it is not dead; [...] it is the first — its existence is not due to any cause; it has power, wisdom, and will — it is not feeble or ignorant; He is One — there are not more Gods than one [...] Every attribute predicated of God denotes either the quality of an action, or, when the attribute is intended to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself — and not of His actions — the negation of the opposite.

If one approaches God apophatically, the contradictions between what you described and God’s attributes become null because God can’t be said to have any true positive attributes.

21 : KrytanComment: &gt;The only replies i’ve heard to this are things along the lines of "your free will is responsible for your destiny, not God". But this just undermines the foreknowledge God's omniscience gives him. If i hold a ball over a river and release it, then destroy the ball on the grounds that it chose to get wet, how is that any different

You don't understand what is meant by the concept of free will, as your analogy is not an example of free will. 

Free will is the idea that agents can freely choose their actions free of external constraints, and thus bear the moral responsibility of those actions. 

&gt;Can i ask you how you rationalise the existence of a being that is omniscient, had the idea of creating adolf hitler, saw that hitler would go to hell if created, chose to create hitler, knowing that hitler would go to hell and then happily sent hitler to hell when his time arrived, telling hitler that the blame was all on him despite the fact that he was the one who used his “omnipotence” to create a being that would go to hell?

I don't see any contradictions here. 

1) God creates a man named adolf hitler. That's fine. 

2) God gives Adolf Hitler free will. That's fine, unless you believe free will doesn't exist or giving people free will is inherently evil

3) Adolf Hitler uses his free will to freely choose to do devil. That's wrong, but that's Adolf Hitler's moral choice, not God's

4) God punishes Adolf Hitler by sending him to hell. This is a requirement for justice, so that seems fine. 

Your complaint seems to be "God didn't use his powers to see that Adolf Hitler would make the wrong choices, and act to prevent it". This may be true, but it's not clear that it is an example of injustice.  Human moral codes explicitly recognize that it is not an example of injustice if you don't act to prevent another from doing wrong. 

You seem to think this principle would apply to an omnipotent and omniscient being, but that's based purely on your own imagination, and you must necessarily have a flawed and incomplete idea of what an omnipotent and omniscient being would be like.  We all do. You've invented a moral code for such a being based on incomplete understanding and applied it to said being, then complained when said being doesn't appear to live up to it. That's fine, but it's not an example of contradiction within Christianity. 

If you're trying to understand *why* an omnipotent and omniscient being wouldn't choose to act in such cases, despite having no moral obligation to, we should  consider the analogy laid out of a father to their children. A human father would choose to, at some point, grand their child enough independence and autonomy to make their own choices, some of which must necessarily end up being wrong or causing grief. They would do this while still loving the child and wanting the best for them, perhaps even while having the ability to prevent such choices. Allowing your child the freedom to fail is an essential part of their growth as they are transitioning from child to adult.

23 : Adnan7631Comment: Each of the three Abrahamic religions have different understandings of the nature of God, reality, and the afterlife. While there is a lot in common, the differences can have significant consequences. For example, Christianity believes that God has three components/parts/aspects known as the trinity, and that one of those aspects was born as a human man named Jesus who was killed and resurrected for a divine purpose. As a result, you need to have a theology that incorporates and justifies that belief into a worldview. In contrast, islam completely rejects that framing of a trinity or the need for God to be born and sacrificed. So the two have very different understandings of God, even though both religions believe in (or at least accept) the teachings of Jesus and the Bible. 

Even within a single religion, there can be very different interpretations. For example, a small number of Islamic scholars believed that Hell is a temporary state, that *everyone* will eventually be admitted to heaven (or at least released from suffering). At the least, most Islamic scholars believe that pious Muslims who nevertheless erred in life enough to wind up in Hell will eventually be released and admitted to Heaven. And that conception has consequences.
--------------------
--------------------
24 : grim-de-vitComment: You seem to be confused about the basic setup of the world according to these religions.

Yes, humans are created as beings with free will. God generally does not interfere in current human affairs, and doesn't reward/punish people based on whether they're good or not, at least not in this world, through physical life events. 

In fact, the Bible mentions this quite explicitly, through quotes like: "When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, people's hearts are filled with schemes to do wrong."

This world, in our current form, isn't here so you can enjoy it and be happy. It's a battlefield. And whatever you do, good or bad, you'll die in the end, and be eventually forgotten. It's the one way in which we are all truly equal. And that is by design.

If everyone who did bad things got cancer, or got struck by a lightning, and if everyone who did good won lotteries and drove around in Rolls Royces, the entire population of Earth would do good for all the wrong reasons. But that's not what God wants. He doesn't need servants who will physically carry out tasks for him, he cares about the human heart, and that won't show it's true face with a carrot and a stick, but exactly by letting it run wild in a world seemingly devoid of consequences.  

That might seem cruel and unfair, and it's easy to say "why doesn't God just fix things?", but it's necessary for growth. In the same way, a baby learning how to walk, if it was more aware of its surroundings, could say "Why is my father letting me struggle with this, and letting me fall and risk injury, when I know he can just carry me across where I need to be?". But the father actually understands why it's necessary, and why carrying the baby every time would actually do it more harm. 

That's also why the concept of Judgement Day exists - that's the point where he actually will interfere, and where there will be true justice. Until then, you're expecting something that was never even promised.

25 : Tea-UnluckyComment: Why would god create the world at all then? I mean the world is full of suffering? Why bother, what’s the point?

Those are questions that no religion will claim to know. In Judaism at least, bad things do happens and are a part of a grand design. God knows what will happen and what everyone decides to do but god knowing what one will choose doesn’t make it any less that person’s choice, as “free will” is inherently a human concept and to apply that to the infinite makes no sense. (Also hell in Judaism isn’t the Christian hell of eternal damnation but that’s a story for another time)
--------------------
--------------------
26 : ThumatingraComment: Omnipotence means "power to do all," not "power to do anything I can put into words in natural language." The distinction is important, because humans can phrase things in natural language that are logically impossible: phrases like "a square circle" or "a married bachelor." Saying "God can create" in front of one these phrases doesn't make it any less of a logical impossibility, by its own internal definitions. Most serious theologians don't think God can do logically impossible things, and note that this isn't a limit on his power, because they aren't things at all, in any possible world. 


As C.S. Lewis pithily put it, "Nonsense the remains nonsense, even when we talk it about God."


The same should apply to omniscience, then: it would be "the ability to know all," i.e. to know anything that is logically possible for God to know. 


This is where you get into different philosophical theories of time. If you are a B-theorist, you think time isn't really tensed, and that past, present, and future all exist concurrently, it just depends on ones perspective. If that's true, God should know all future outcomes, because God exists outside of the "block" of time. However, it also follows that God created the whole block in an instant: i.e. he created the Big Bang, the dinosaurs, Adolf Hitler and Ghandi in the same instant. So it doesn't really work the way you've described it: he didn't see what Hitler would do and create him, he just created this whole story at once. Wherever it is leading, this is how it apparently has to get there.


If you're an A-theorist about time, though, you believe that time *is* did a mentally tensed, i.e. that the future just doesn't exist. If that's true, God can *predict* the future based on a huge amount of past and present evidence, but God can't actually *see* the future, because that's logically impossible. Under this view, human free will is an act of God giving power to humans to do things he might not be able to predict, as free will would allow humans to act beyond the mechanistic limitations of non-sapient matter. So God may not always know what humans will choose in advance. This view is also called "Open Theism," and several theologians hold it. It still posits that God is omniscient, as God knows all that is logically possible to know—it just posits that fewer things are logically possible to know than one might assume.


By the way, I do think it matters to your point whether one believes in Hell in the traditional sense or not. Eternal conscious torment, especially if it is the fate of most humans, may make either or both of the possible worlds I've sketched out above seem like they're not worth any eventual outcome. I don't know if I can substantiate that view rationally, but I am sympathetic to it. As it happens, I'm not (and have never been) a Christian, so that's never really been an issue for me. But my point is that, when you take that off the table, there are reasonable answers to your questions.

Just because he can, doesnt mean he will.There is a reason he only does a few prophicies and that he doesnt do it any more.

He only chose to set in stone a few broad strokes of human existance. Writing all of reality from the start goes against the reason he made people in the first place. He give everyone free will becuase he wanted people to listen to him out of love,not by destiny or programmed obediance.

28 : Appropriate-Camp5170Comment: I mean the bible is a dualistic description of the same thing other religions like Hinduism talks about from a non dualistic framework. God = Brahman, sin = karma, hell = maya. Through a dualistic perspective your separate from god and things are defined through their opposites. Good/bad, god/devil, ying/yang etc. your not separate from god though and Jesus actually did teach this but the dualistic framework was useful for the understanding of the time.

Think of it like this… God creates the heavens and the earth, creates souls, souls incarnate and forget their nature. The reason for incarnation is growth and the soul may set it up so it experiences specific events to learn. These are typically called soul contracts by spiritualists.

Now suffering is meant to be a teacher. Your born with original sin because your incarnation needs to wake up in order to fully complete what it wants. Thing is this isn’t going to be the case if everything is awesome all the time because you’ll never look inward to truly know yourself and you’ll get caught up in the physical world. If you don’t know yourself your free will is kind of limited because your subconscious drives the majority of your life. You adopt others beliefs, others ideas, others limitations. You never really know what you want from life. It’s not done to you it’s done for you. If you don’t learn your lesson you will keep attracting it into your experience.

Now through a dualistic description you would see that suffering is bad because it sucks balls(but if you do the work you will feel differently about it) but the truth is that it’s done for you and done in love so you can eventually realise how reality operates and become a co creator of your own reality and you can live your best life. The universe does this through your thoughts and emotions. So if your in a negative headspace and emotional space you will see the world in a negative light. This attracts more negativity and creates more suffering like a feedback loop until you change your mindset. Like attracts like…

Now in the case of Hitler what you have is someone being born into a world that doesn’t understand self reflection but is pretty technologically advanced. Because people don’t self reflect they project. Because we’ve forgotten the value of self reflection and the wisdom in these teachings we don’t realise that everything we hate about others is part of us and by denying it and judging it we’re denying and judging part of ourselves. Because reality is ultimately non dualistic every single person is a unique perspective of god itself. We’re all the same thing that’s forgot what it was and basically mock the idea that there is a god even though we are it. This isn’t a great self care philosophy and because we project onto reality because of the lack of self inquiry we see the issue as being everywhere else instead of within us. Basically what happens is this negativity builds until it reaches a breaking point and pressure needs to be released

And thus we have the current state of the world… All religions are just a different description of the same thing. Because that thing is impossible to define in a single way all the descriptions are slightly different but they all are pointing towards the same thing just filtered through the culture and understanding of the time.

I suggest reading some Gnosticism which is an early Christian sect. A bunch of those descriptions are more useful and interesting than the bible imo. There’s a lot of interesting stuff in the bible but it seems the church omitted all the gospels with knowledge on how to directly experience god instead of blindly believe.

Just remember that these are descriptions of how reality operates. At the base of it all it’s just energy and vibration of the one thing that loves unconditionally and from that the entirety of existence has always kept churning. No beginning, no end. Just the here and now, always. Everything within it goes through cycles. Nothing ever dies it just changes form. There’s no eternal hell. Hell is just not escaping the trap of the illusion with its suffering and being reincarnated until your soul understands how to navigate so it can move on up to the next level.

Bible isn’t wrong but it’s just one perspective of the same experience filtered through the culture and understanding of the time. Buddhism, Hinduism, hermeticism, Gnosticism and more all try and describe an aspect of the same thing. You’ll never get a complete description of every aspect of it though.

29 : josh145bComment: Judaism doesn’t really believe in hell. Judaism also doesn’t believe God is omnibenevolent. It sounds like you are talking only about Christianity. What I know of Islam would lead me to believe that they don’t see God as omnibenevolent as well. We also don’t believe in the devil. No offense, but you seem rather ignorant on Judaism. Judaism reconciled the problem of evil thousands of years ago, because god is not omnibenevolent, so we do not have to assume that he is doing everything out of pure goodness. For example, one theory is that choosing good only has value if evil is possible. Is this a benevolent reason to have evil possible? No, but god is not omnibenevolent, so it just needs to have some sort of rationale behind it.

30 : Elsecaller_17-5Comment: The problem of evil is one of the first things addressed in Christian philosophy. It tries to reconcile a omnipotent, omniscient, all good God with the existence of evil. Most Christian philosophers, amateur and with professional, are willing to acknowledge that God is not truly omnipotent. The existence of evil is evident that God  can't eradicate evil. With this in mind scripture reading that God is omnipotent is usally read as "compared to us." Please note, this is super pared down. This was about 6 lectures in my intro to religious philosophy class. The Epicurean paradox is a good place to dig into more, but note, that doesn't necessarily look at the Abrahamic God. It can still be applied.

To address another broad point, many religions have many views on Hell. Many don't give concrete answers on what it will look like. Almost everyone agrees it won't be a torture chamber. Speaking to my theology, I'm LDS, Capital H Hell is called outer darkness and is going to be populated by Satan, his angels, and some uniquely evil beings like Judas Iscariot, betrayer of Christ. No clue what that would look like, but Hitler isn't nearly evil enough to get there. Those unrepentant of their sins (which yeah, judge not that ye be not judged, but let's just use Hitler as an example because you did) are going to end up in the Telestial Kingdom which could be described as hell. This is doctrine, but our founder Joseph Smith reportedly claimed that it is so great that if you saw it you would kill yourself to try and get there faster. Modern thought tends to think of it as a lot like our earth, but if no one sinned. If everyone was Christlike. That'd sounds a lot like heaven, and we do consider it *a* heaven.

This is starting to get a little evangelical, and that isn't my intent. But I am trying to empathize that "Abrahamic after lives" are not a monolith and I'm only equipt to elaborate on my own religion. We believe that we have always existed, and we always will exist, and if we continue to prove ourselves we'll continue to enter fundamentally higher states. In between these states we know what the next holds. Hitler knew what he was going to do, Hitler knew he was going to harming himself more than anyone, all of Hitler's victims knew all that too, and everyone decided it was worth it. It **does not make it right** it being evil is in fact why this life is probably the highest he will get. But there was consent of a kind. That's hard to comprehend in a temporal life, but it loops back to the problem of evil.

33 : AltruisticMode9353Comment: You need more philosophical ideas to start to attempt to resolve these sorts of contradictions, IMO. These ideas are sometimes only hinted at in the a Christian Bible, and most mainstream Christians would disagree with a lot of them, but I don't think any are explicitly denied in the Bible, and much of any modern religion's dogma is based on consensus interpretation rather than real understanding of what the core messages are.


Some of these ideas include:



Open-individualism (all subjects of experience are the same, there is only one true subject - God). 


All beings' essence is identical to that of God (Atman = Brahman in Hinduism terms). 


God, being omnipotent, is able to veil their own omnipotence (not being able to do so would be a limitation). Under this veil, God acts as if they're not omnipotent, not omniscient, etc. This veil is necessary for God to experience all of God, to make the unrealized infinite potential into realized, limited actualities (an infinite amount of them). This is known as Maya and Lila in Hinduism. All beings are God with various degrees of veiling.


The purpose of reality is for God to experience God, progressively unveiling God until God-realization occurs. Souls pass through countless reincarnations in this process.


Hell is not an eternal punishment, but a place where souls, having incurred negative impressions over the course of their evolution/journey, can become "cleansed". The idea that a soul is permanently in hell comes from translations, not the original texts. (Note that I think a lot of confusion in general is due to what is lost in translation).


Free-will exists because God allows God to act out in ignorance, but there's always a perspective of God that has full knowledge of the ultimate unfolding for all souls (hence omniscience is always real and preserved). God sees that this unfoldment is ultimately good and worth it, despite the suffering that God experiences due to it.
--------------------
--------------------
34 : leafshakerComment: I'm not a Christian or otherwise religious, but I do read a lot on the topic and am very interested in the philosophy. 

A central tenet is that God is ultimately unknowable by mortal minds, so what seems like a contraction to us may just be beyond our comprehension,  like trying to imagine colors beyond our range of vision.

If God is all powerful, all knowing, and all good, it seems impossible that he would create evil or create circumstances he couldn't foresee. But, that is superseded by being all-powerful. Whats to say he uses his power to create blindspots for himself so he cant see the results of free-choice?

Can good exist without evil to define it? 

There are many contradictions in the Bible. According to the Documentary Hypothesis, the Bible was compiled in stages by different archivists who collected writings from different parts of the Hebrew world, so they have slightly different tellings of events. 

I dont think this discredits anything in the Bible, it squares with the events in the Tower of Babel, which seems to suggest we shouldnt distract ourselves with comprehending God.

Christianity resolves many of its issues with Jesus. The radical forgiveness and promise of eternity mean that any evil on earth is infitely small compared to the goodness of heaven. People who have committed grave evils can repent, they are not necessarily set up for hell. I dont believe there is a sin so bad that heaven is barred, as long as the sinner accepts they have done evil and asks for forgiveness.

There is also a wide range of beliefs about the nature of heaven and hell, and different interpretations of Bible passages. The Bible itself really doesnt say much about hell, most of society's associations with it come from outside of the Bible.

35 : itay162Comment: The Jewish answer is that yes, God giving humans free will does diminish from his omnipotence, however that is exactly what he chose to do, although he is completely capable of taking that ability back, he just chooses not to most of the time (iirc there's only one moment in the Torah when God took away someone's free will temporarily). This is different from your ball analogy because the ball works by completely predictable newtonian physics but Judaism rejects your assertion that humans work in that same deterministic way.
You can disagree with that assertion but I don't see how it's contradictory. As to the question of evil, the evil that comes from humans choosing evil is their fault and responsibility, but the Hebrew Bible does mention God creating both the good and the bad in nature, so you could say the Jewish god is a normal benevolent and not omnibenevolent (although that would probably anger some people).

 Calvinist Christianity, however, does combine a belief in the abrahamic God and a deterministic view of humanity, like the one you hold. They believe that everyone who goes to hell and isn't saved is actually getting exactly what they deserve, and the faithful people who go to heaven don't go there because they were good but strictly because God chose to gift them with the gift of believing in this life and being in heaven in the next for his own, entirely incomprehensible reasons.
That still leaves the question of why create people who are going to harm others, but as I am Jewish and not a Calvinist, I don't know what they would say about that and I couldn't find anything, but that just means you should ask one of them, not that there isn't an answer.

37 : myboobiezarequitebigComment: 
&gt; Can I ask you how you rationalize the existence

I think part of the difficulty here is that any attempt to rationalize a being like the God of the Abrahamic religions is always going to fall short by design. God is supposed to be omnipotent which fundamentally places him outside the bounds of human logic and comprehension. As a result, whenever we try to make sense of his actions or intentions using the tools of reason and moral intuition available to us, we inevitably run into contradictions or moral absurdities like the scenario you laid out with Hitler or any soul ending up in hell.

This is far different than Greek or Roman deities, for example, where they are a lot more human in motivation. It’s a lot easier to understand why they do things. They’re not really tauted as being all powerful  beings that can do whatever they want. They have recognized limitations. The big three don’t operate in these bounds.

This is where many theists tend to respond with some variation of, “God’s ways are not our ways.” And I think that’s key: the system isn’t built to be understandable, it’s built to transcend understanding. In that context, suffering, damnation, or even divine justice aren’t necessarily things we’re meant to “get” in a human sense. We’re asked to trust that there’s a higher reason, a divine logic at work, even when it looks cruel or nonsensical from our perspective.
--------------------
--------------------
38 : tquidleyComment: Yahweh is a figure of contradictions because he represents the fusion of multiple deities and theological systems into a single monotheistic god.

Jewish monotheism did not emerge fully formed, it evolved gradually from henotheistic or monolatristic Yahwism, which itself developed out of the polytheistic religions of Canaan, Midian, and Ugarit. In these early traditions, the ancient Hebrews, Canaanites, and Israelites worshipped a host of deities including Yahweh, El, Baal, and Asherah (Yahweh’s consort). Yahweh himself was merely a god of metallurgy from Edom or Midian, later adopted and adapted by the Israelites.

As the Kingdom of Israel formed, Yahweh gradually absorbed the attributes of El, the Canaanite high god known as "El Elyon" (“God Most High”). Under kings like David and Solomon, Yahweh was elevated to the status of national deity, and the worship of other gods was actively suppressed. Aspects of these suppressed deities (like Baal’s storm power or El’s fatherly rulership) were incorporated into Yahweh’s character.

This theological evolution explains Yahweh’s dramatic transformation: from a fiery, tempestuous, tribal war-god in the most ancient Hebrew texts, to a universal creator, moral judge, and king of heaven in later scriptures, and finally to a compassionate, paternal figure in Christian theology. Even Jesus Christ can be seen as a synthesis of traditions, combining the Canaanite idea of divine sons of El with Hellenistic “divine man” archetypes, resulting in a literalized, incarnate Son of God.

It's also important to note that the books of the Bible were not actually written in whole or in canonical chronological order. Because later theological developments, like Yahweh’s role as universal creator or moral judge, seemingly appear early in the Bible, it's easy to miss that these ideas actually developed much later. Without reading the texts in their true anthropological context, the composite, self-contradictory nature of Yahweh’s identity can appear seamless rather than layered and historically constructed.

39 : SendMeYourDPicsComment: Yeah you’re not crazy for thinking all that sounds off. A lot of it is a mess, and most people just don’t admit it because they’re scared of what happens if they stop pretending it makes perfect sense. 

The version of God you’re describing (the all-knowing, all-powerful, all-loving being who still greenlights infinite torment) is a theological dead end. People try to patch it with “mystery” or “free will,” but that doesn’t fix the part where he chose to make a world that plays out exactly how he knew it would. Less free will more scripting tragedy and calling it justice. 

The real shift comes when you stop trying to force logic into a belief that was never built for coherence and start asking: does this version of God deserve my loyalty? And if not, then what does? 

That’s where the actual freedom starts, not in finding better answers, but in realizing you’re allowed to stop defending bad ones.
--------------------
--------------------
40 : ThrowawaytrashpandComment: Let’s break it down into 2 different topics please

1) the idea of free will.. yes we have free will. We also have a thing called consequences. You’re free to do really anything, but every action has a consequence, whether it be good or bad; and the ultimate consequences at the end of your days is heaven or hell. However, in the grand scheme of that, whether you choose to accept Christ is the only thing that’ll matter to get you into Heaven. And those who truly accept Christ will generally choose actions that are moral or good because of the repentant nature of accepting Christ. 

This comes down to my second thing.. sin.
In Christianity, God IS omnipotent and omnipresent. God knew before He created man that they would eventually go against His word.. in the Bible, Genesis talks about the original sin and fall of man. God gave them literally 1 ‘do not do’… one thing…. Don’t eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.. ONE SIMPLE RULE.

However… one of Christ’s own angels, the one who was actually the leader of worship, Lucifer decided HE wanted to be God.. he wanted to be the one calling the shots, and took 1/3 of the angels with him when he fell.. and that is who ultimately was able to use trickery to trick Eve into disobedience, by trying to discredit what God said (if you eat the fruit you will die) and them trying to appeal to what everyone wants.. knowledge and power. 

However, God stepping in to change or reset or erase anything is against His nature, and would rob us of the free will God gave. That’s why Jesus came and was sacrificed on the cross in 33 AD

Some people believe that god is, for lack of a better description, a highly advanced alien race using humans as a resource for energy. It’s up to humans how that energy is produced. No matter the choices we make, god’s creation functions as necessary. If we love one another the goal is achieved. But the same energy can be collected through suffering. Our free will, when influenced by Satan, makes it a painful process hence the directions to be good by God. Abrahamic religions play a part but the whole truth is hidden from us by design. Very weird rabbit hole.

43 : Kaleb_BuntComment: I like to think that being God is a tough job and that while from our perspective, God is all powerful, there are limitations on what God can and cannot do.

I think God does his best but that evil exists in spite of this, because God cannot literally control every single thing that happens.

God is said to be our father. A father aids in the creation of a child. A father protects a child. A father provides for a child. A father offers a child guidance and direction. But even if a father does his absolute best, he still cannot protect his children from everything.

44 : cephalordComment: &gt;but they never seem to be able to pair True Omniscience and True Omnipotence together

The beauty of 'true' omnipotence is that it doesn't have to make sense.

Can God create a stone so heavy He cannot lift it? Yes. And then he can still lift it. Can God be omniscient and still bestow free will? Sure, why not. True omnipotence means an entity is not bound to our logic systems either.

To be clear; I don't think that is a particularly good argument. But it is internally consistent with itself.

45 : minaminonoeruComment: If God is truly a transcendent being, it is natural that you cannot understand His logic and attributes.

Conversely, if you (who are merely a human being) can logically understand His attributes and the way He exists, then He cannot be considered a truly transcendent being.

Of course, you have the freedom to distrust and deny beings that you cannot understand. Even if you decide to do so, there is no problem. Neither you, nor I, nor God, nor the world.

46 : NepeneComment: You're making the assumption that omniscience reliably means you have perfect future prediction powers.

The bible notes the lord changing their mind at times, in response to human choices. 

Exodus 32:14 “So the Lord changed His mind about the harm which He said He would do to His people.”  

Amos 7:3 “The Lord changed His mind about this. ‘It shall not be,’ said the Lord.”

Jonah 3:10 “When God saw their deeds, that they turned from their wicked way, then God relented concerning the calamity which He had declared He would bring upon them. And He did not do it.”

It might be that God has perfect future prediction and perfect ability to influence the future, but that the maximal capacity of that can't reliably predict the future.

Okay, I'm definitely going to catch hell for this one, but I think our obsession with pathologizing everything is doing more harm than good.

Like, when did we decide that being sad sometimes means you have depression? Or that getting nervous before a big presentation means you have an anxiety disorder? I swear every other person I know is self-diagnosing with something based on TikTok videos or online quizzes.

My little cousin told me last week that she thinks she has ADHD because she gets distracted during boring classes. I'm like... yeah, that's called being a teenager in algebra class, not a neurological condition. But now she's convinced there's something wrong with her brain instead of just accepting that some stuff is tedious.

And don't even get me started on how everything is "trauma" now. Your parents made you do chores? Trauma. Your teacher was strict? Trauma. Someone was mean to you in middle school? Trauma. Like, I get that actual trauma is real and serious, but we've watered down the term so much that it's lost all meaning.

I think this whole thing is actually making people more fragile, not less. Instead of learning that uncomfortable emotions are normal and temporary, we're teaching people that feeling bad means something is medically wrong with them. So instead of developing coping skills, people just assume they need therapy or medication for every little thing.

And the worst part is that this probably makes it harder for people with actual mental health conditions to get taken seriously. When everyone claims to have anxiety or depression, it becomes background noise instead of a real signal that someone needs help.

I'm not saying mental health isn't real - obviously it is. Depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, all that stuff is absolutely real and serious. This is coming from someone who has mental issues herself. But I think we've gone way too far in the other direction where we're medicalizing normal human experiences.

Like, sometimes you're just having a bad day. Sometimes you're stressed because your life is actually stressful. Sometimes you're sad because sad things happened. That's not a disorder, that's just being human.

3 : OrnamentalHermanComment: "When did we decide that being sad sometimes means you have depression? Or that getting nervous before a big presentation means you have an anxiety disorder?"


I don't know, when did we? These things would not result in a formal diagnosis of a mental health condition. That generally requires a much more rigorous examination and usually a reference to a specialist.


Is there any evidence that any rise in self-diagnosis is having a negative impact on rates of medical diagnosis or treatment?

6 : kingpatzerComment: \&gt; being sad sometimes means you have depression

Your understanding of mental health diagnostic criteria seems to be non-existent.

The criteria for being diagnosed with a depressive disorder are **5 or more** of the following present **over at least 2 week period**, and must include 1 of the first 2:

* Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (eg, feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observations made by others (eg, appears tearful). (NOTE: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)
* Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).
* Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (eg, a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (NOTE: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
* Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
* Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
* Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
* Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).
*  Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by their subjective account or as observed by others).
* Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.

Further, the symptoms cause **clinically significant distress or impairment** in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., drug abuse, a prescribed medication’s side effects) or a medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism). There has never been a manic episode or hypomanic episode. And, MDE is not better explained by schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders.

The symptoms can not be in response to signiciant loss such as bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability.

Does that sound like "being sad sometimes" to you?

That sometimes people use the term "depression" to say they are experiencing sadness, does not mean that they confuse being sad with having depression, any more than someone saying they feel manic means they think they have bipolar disorder.

Similiarly, your idea that someone being mean to you in school doesn't equate to trauma . . . well, I'll just leave this here:

7 : carbonclumpsComment: We've all got problems. We all deserve relief.   
When something is causing you discomfort enough that you seek out a doctor to give it a name speaks volumes. Having a name for what ails you, any name, is at the very least a starting line to some kind of solution and validation.   
People with anxiety and ADHD often have an immense fear of others judging them, even though they don't really care what other people think. It's impossible to explain to someone who doesn't experience it but no one should have to live life playing a playstation game on an xbox (our brains literally interpret reality in a different, but quantifiable way).   
Humans have suffered in silence for a long time because "we all go through it". Yes, we do. Trauma is complex and we have all experienced it, but some brains synthesize the experience in a completely different way than most people. It's very dismissive and disingenuous to equate doing chores as trauma. Sure, we've all been traumatized at some point but not everyone absorbed that experience into their entire survival model.   
When people were dying of the plague they did all kids of crazy shit cause they didn't know what it was. I mean we tried to ignore covid, why would we not try to ignore autism? I truly believe there's just A LOT more people on the spectrum/adhd than we thought.  
The more we know, the more complete analysis can become on individuals who may be a bit defective, but fixable, to put it bluntly.   
Therapy is WONDERFUL. I don't have coverage so I use ChatGPT as a sounding board, "no cap". It's just a place where someone gently encourages you to see your situation from other perspectives and brainstorm healthy behavioral solutions. Everyone could benefit from therapy and if 90% of people were going we'd live in a better world.  
I've been diagnosed with MDD since I was sixteen having had symptoms of anxiety documented from early childhood (at this point I have more diagnoses than fingers), and I spent years resenting people who claimed to be "depressed". Sometimes it's a teachable moment, sometimes they're just being dramatic for a second, sometimes they're really suffering from the wide range of clinical depression symptoms. You never know what is REALLY going on behind anyone's eyes. Depression is not just feeling sad and doctors know that. You don't get diagnosed with depression cause you've had the blues for a few days. There's half a dozen other markers to tick before you get the title.   
Therapy has helped me immensely personally. Maybe I don't have a magic pill to fix what's going on in my head but I can work around or get over the hurdles in life if I'm mindful about it. I would not be the person I am today without therapy.   
We do all go through shit and we go through dramatic phases and life is hard no doubt...  
But we should never shut the gate on someone who thinks they might be suffering from something that can be alleviated with a diagnosis and treatment.

8 : CursedPoetryComment: I get the sentiment you’re expressing, and I actually agree with parts of it; like, yeah, not every uncomfortable emotion is a mental illness, and over-pathologizing can be unhelpful. But I think the way you’re framing it oversimplifies what’s really going on.

Take your cousin, for example. You mentioned she thinks she has ADHD because she zones out in math class. But that might just be the part she knows how to say. It’s possible she’s also experiencing time blindness, emotional dysregulation, forgetfulness, etc., but doesn’t have the vocabulary to describe it yet. I say this from experience as I got tested for ADHD myself, and turns out I had it. Same with depression. A lot of people don’t realize what they’re experiencing is abnormal for others until they see a video or post describing it, and then it clicks.

You also bring up “trauma inflation,” and yeah, the word gets thrown around too casually sometimes. But I think most people actually do have a sense of scale. Like, no one’s saying spilling coffee is the same as your mom being in stage 4 cancer. But something like constant verbal abuse, or growing up in a high-stress environment, even if it’s not “war PTSD” can still rewire how you respond to the world, and that’s valid too (so really this just shows how words change over time and how “trauma” really just means an event that has impacted you emotionally to any specificity).

What I’m trying to say is: people who are casually self-diagnosing usually either (a) don’t have access to formal healthcare, or (b) are experiencing consistent distress and are trying to make sense of it. And a lot of them do go get tested eventually. If they’re constantly talking about depression or anxiety, maybe it’s not attention-seeking maybe it’s persistence.

So yes, uncomfortable emotions are part of life. But if someone’s feeling stuck in those emotions long-term, that’s when it crosses into something worth looking into. I don’t think most people are confusing “a bad day” with clinical depression but if they are, they’ll figure it out as they go. That’s life too.

9 : crookedwalls88Comment: Honestly, as a therapist myself, this is pretty accurate. Many clients come to me saying they want to find tools to deal with frustration, or sadness, or anxiety, but it turns out to be a normal level of frustration in response to frustrating things. They aren't frustrated by little things, don't explode when frustrated, sometimes they have great coping mechanisms already, whether that's some form of breath work, taking space, etc. They say some variation of "ya, but I'm still getting frustrated when  my boss *insert objectively frustrating thing* or *I'm still feeling anxious about the massive surgery my husband needs to have next month that could kill him* We are supposed to feel anger, sadness, and fear in response to life. It's if we stay stuck there, or our reactions to those emotions are harmful to ourselves or others, or we are having these emotions constantly, that we may need help. A large chunk of my work now days is helping my clients tolerate emotions, after I can get them to see how impossible it is to never feel them.

10 : Jayn_NewellComment: It can be hard to tell the difference between normal human variation and mental illness, however we tend to label things as an illness or disorder when it is impacting a person’s life. It is normal to feel nervous before a presentation, it isn’t normal to throw up from that anxiety. It is normal for your attention to wander when things are a bit boring, but a person with ADD *physically can’t focus* and medication can make it much easier for them to because their brain is wired differently.

Unfortunately there’s a tendency towards self-diagnosis and lay-people adopting terms to refer to that normal variation (“oh I’m so OCD”) that blurs the line between what is and isn’t medical in nature. But this can also be helpful for people by giving them a framework to understand themselves better and helping them find tools to better navigate their lives. People with autism may be unable or unwilling to get a formal diagnosis, for example, but self-diagnosing can help them find a community of people who share similar struggles and who have advice on how to manage them, or at least commiserate so they feel less alone.

11 : CaptainB0ngWaterComment: I feel like there is way more nuance to this conversation than what you are describing. Regarding social media, I can agree that the pendulum has swung maybe a little too far in terms of self diagnosis and extreme over-pathologizing, but on the other hand it’s really opened up the conversation for people who may have been struggling with conditions they weren’t even aware of, but can now identify and seek help for.

But, and this is a Big but, as someone who actually has ADHD and was not diagnosed for about 30 years, into adulthood, there is a massive difference. I grew up being told it is only normal feelings, you're just weird, why don't you remember anything that I just told you to do. Trust me, the other side of the non-diagnosis is really not fun either. People just thinking you're stressed out or not serious about school or work, because you lose focus, thinking the person is just a dreamer. But if I had been diagnosed earlier, I could have had better grades, better opportunities and basically a whole new life. I'm happy for what I have and thankful for it, but opportunities were definitely lost.

So letting people self-diagnose is not the solution either, but getting real support, that is something worth having.

13 : robdingo36Comment: Normal human emotions ARE mental health conditions, when they start to interfere with your day to day life.  And just like you can see a doctor because you've got a cold, you should be able to just as easily see a therapist to help deal with the loss of a bad break up, or worse.

People should be able to go in to a therapists office for mental health check ips, just as if they went in for their yearly physical.

Mental health should be treated no differently than physical health.

14 : loopy183Comment: &gt;self-diagnosing with something based on TikTok videos or online quizzes

I mean, your issue is right there. Of course people will inaccurately self diagnose. It isn’t the fault of medical practice learning about the human psyche and creating new diagnoses that cover the issues they find.

Personally, I’m of the mindset that self diagnosis is fine as long as it doesn’t lead to self medication. Being aware of issues that exist can lead to getting treatment. My mom insists none of us have autism because she never had us tested and turned out fine. My sister got diagnosed proper recently and we all look at my little brother as certainly also being autistic. My older brother struggled with undiagnosed ADHD until college, when it was too late to change the coping mechanisms around it. I’m sure I’ve got a bevy of issues but therapy is expensive and I impulsively put up an “Oh, no, everything is fine” façade whenever it comes time to discuss how I’m doing mentally.

And I guess that’s the other thing, too. You don’t know fully what’s going on in other peoples’ heads, so it’s easier to discredit the idea that they potentially are mentally ill. Proper diagnosis of mental illness comes when the mental status interferes with normal life. You called out normal emotions being called mental illness, but have you considered you aren’t seeing the full picture? Maybe that “occasional sadness” manifests as staring into the void for three hours a day contemplating suicide. You wouldn’t be there for that. Maybe that nervousness manifests as nightmares and avoidance of peers to avoid further perceived humiliation.  You won’t see that. Maybe your cousin cares about those boring classes but faces the endless frustration of not being able to focus and being unable to understand because of it. You’d probably wave off the idea that I consider not being allowed to date in high school a traumatic experience. But it took the form of not being allowed to be myself around peers or family, so I never trusted anyone around me nor believed that any connection was genuine for the fear of losing any modicum of security and any potential at a good life. The point isn’t that you should counter diagnose, you should support them in _getting help_

15 : Sufficient_PlatypusComment: I think this isn’t new - people have always taken medical diagnoses and applied them to themselves or others without the help of medical professional. The terms idiot and moron both used to be medical terms but popular usage led to them falling out of favor as technical terms. 

If someone thinks they have a condition based on an imprecise understanding of a medical diagnosis, they’ll seek treatment and a competent professional will determine if they’re correct or not. People self-diagnose their physical conditions too and end up being wrong. It’s not a crisis or anything new.
--------------------
--------------------
16 : Defiant_Put_7542Comment: ADHD is extremely underdiagnosed in women and girls. You have no idea if your cousin has it or not. Like many conditions, it's way less obvious precisely because the symptoms are different but criteria revolve around men (this extends even to heart attacks, meaning the mortality rate is greater for women that have one). 

Be wary of doing anything that would put her off seeking diagnosis if she feels that is necessary; that will have life long negative impacts.

Perhaps you should be putting your energy into looking to see if your 'mental issues' might actually be diagnostically relevant; you sound quite dismissive of yourself and your own experiences. It's actually really useful to be able to identify things correctly because then it can be tackled in the right way.

17 : reddituserperson1122Comment: Most of this is about the collision between modern capitalism and the normal range of human emotion and capacity. If we didn’t have to get up and go to work every day doing not-normal-human shit in order to eat and not sleep on the sidewalk you wouldn’t see all this. No one evolved to sit all day at a desk when they’re 12 or work in a cubicle or an Amazon warehouse when they’re 25 or 65. However some people are better at it than others. 

Mental health conditions are *disabilities.* People seek them out because they give name to the things they don’t have the ability to do. Or do as easily as others seem to be able to do them. 

TL:DR there is a discontinuity between the behaviors expected by modern western society and the full range of normal human behavior.

18 : Purple_Fish25Comment: While I can understand wanting people to not make themselves worse off by assigning themselves a condition they might not have, I do believe that the answer is actually *more* education on the topics. I have clinally diagnosed anxiety and depression, and I was not as educated on neurodivergencies as a kid.
  When people only have access to small amounts of information, oftentimes that small amount can be taken and morphed into something that the true original idea didn't necessarily describe. It's like when you think of a memory and over time it morphs because your brain takes the path that uses less energy to recall distant memories bc of how insignificant they can be in relation to your present moment. 
    To get back to the mental health misdiagnosing of generally healthy people, if they have full access to a list of symptoms, they are able to better understand the severity of their condition in relation to what other people without it experience. It's like a Checklist, and if you don't meet the requirements, it's not you most times. However, I will always be an advocate of seeing a psych doctor to further investigate a condition if that is an available option, and you're truly concerned. 
    Although, there is widespread use of mental health language to describe a generally normal experience, such as saying "omg I'm so ocd" when you simply prefer a clean space, without it impacting your internal sense of safety or overriding what you may want/need to do. OCD infringes upon a person's ability to complete at least some daily tasks, which is why it's labeled a mental disability/disorder. It's a way that the brain functions maladaptively. That's not to say that people with conditions can't live full and happy lives, but more often than not, it will make it much more difficult.
    If we are able to collectively begin to fall away from using mental health language when describing normal emotions, I do believe that it could bring a lot of stress down for everyone. However, to stop using this language at all will usually lead to people not knowing that what they experience doesn't have to be so difficult, like when someone finally hears about a health condition that they never had known the words for. Sometimes people will go their whole lives before being clinically diagnosed with autism or schizophrenia. Both can lead to very harsh day to day lives if not treated/diagnosed as early as others. 
    If people don't know what's truly not normal, they cant really begin to make life easier or more fulfilling for themselves and others around them. So the answer is more information, not less

20 : Some-Watercress-1144Comment: With regards to your hyperboles of people saying “I think I have this”, they haven’t necessarily ruled out going to a doctor/specialist first, and they could just be monitoring symptoms. 

I’d say that people trying to learn more about themselves and be more conscious of their behaviours and mental health is a great thing. Without all this information online, most mental health issues as well as most physical health issues would probably go unchecked. Hell, they hardly teach us this stuff in school…. We’d be doomed

From your examples (children and teens?), it seems to me that you see a problem with people on TikTok hyping different mental health conditions so that they have gained what you feel is undue cultural relevance combined with a, dare I say, curmudgeonly take on the role of personal responsibility. It might be interesting for you to reflect on why this bothers you so much in others…

"Normal" is a wide reaching term that absolves itself because anything a person goes through could be considered normal. My father used to threaten to kill me with a 30/30 every other week.

25 : Alshee1Comment: I think one issue is that everyone self diagnoses. 

I am diagnosed with inattentive ADHD and take medication 4x as strong as the base tablets. My ADHD caused me a world of troubles throughout my life. I usually don't tell people about my ADHD unless I need to, but when i do at least 50% of people are like "oh yeah me too I think" obviously in some cases it maybe true, but I believe less than 5% of people are actually diagnosed with ADHD.

Additionally I think the bar of a diagnosis is a lot lower than it used to be, especially with autism. When I was a kid the idea of an autistic person was someone that struggles to tie their own shoe laces, now days everyone says they're autistic. I get that it is a spectrum so technically everyone can have autism to a degree, but the level of which someone needs to be diagnosed is so much lower than it used to be.

26 : Retr0r0cketVersion2Comment: As a child of a therapist and psychiatrist who has diagnosed ADHD and anxiety:

1. Professionals are more aware that these things are neurological conditions than before
2. Society is way more open about it compared to when my parents are growing up
3. Some people say it like they say an action of theirs was "gay," but that doesn't mean people aren't gay
4. It doesn't have to be obvious at first sight. I often do super well on schoolwork, am driven, and have no issues interacting with people. However, other times I cannot focus without medication no matter how much I try, I forget things in ways normal people just don't, and I have crippling anxiety that spirals into panic attacks. Same with others
5. You're whitewashing over traumatic experiences that often lead to a rewiring of your brain that then cause these things (this can also happen from drugs. My friend's thinking changed so much after he took shrooms it's wild). You don't have to nearly die or be sexually assaulted for it to trigger something
6. Medication can be a godsend (like for me) and therapy is both a place where you develop those coping skills and are able to talk about things in a safe manner which is extremely good for your mental health.

27 : WeAreKyleComment: I can’t speak for everyone but you seem to have a very flawed view of what depression and anxiety are. I don’t know if you’re young, misguided, uninformed, or all of the above, so I’m going to be nice and try to help you understand because you seem ignorant rather than malicious. I’ll try to explain the best I can.

Depression and Anxiety disorder aren’t being sad or nervous sometimes. They are crippling extremes that affect MANY aspects of your life. During my depressive episodes I lack all emotion whatsoever. I’m incapable of feeling joy, sadness, anger, boredom, excitement, anything. I stop eating for days at a time because I have no appetite and any attempt to eat results in vomiting. This results in extreme weight loss (I’m a 31 year old man who weighs 130 lbs soaking wet so I can’t afford to lose weight) and blood sugar problems which lead me to hypoglycemia which can be fatal. I can’t get out of bed sometimes and I struggle to do even the most basic life functions like hygiene or chores around the house. My anxiety causes me to lose the ability to swallow and I will sometimes choke on even a sip of water. I will go days without being able to sleep. I’ve had panic attacks that required me to be crowd-surfed out of a concert I paid hundreds for a ticket to. This is not “getting a little nervous.” This is debilitating not only to me but my wife and two children who I love with everything I have. Being sad sometimes usually does not affect your loved ones in my experience. 

Disclaimer: these disorders are not because of my upbringing. I grew up comfortable with loving parents and extended family, friends, hobbies, did well in school, etc. my issues do not stem from Abuse. They are just there and there’s not a lot I can do about it besides meds and therapy. Those aren’t 100% effective and come with their own host of problems which make mental issues worse. It’s not pretty. 

It seems to me like you’re talking about people who self-diagnose on the internet. That’s not pathology. To say “being sad sometimes is not depression” while technically correct, shows that you have a very very deep misunderstanding of what these disorders actually are. Nobody likes people who self diagnose for clout or because they think it’s quirky. Literally nobody. You aren’t special or unique for having that thought. You sound like my boomer father used to before he understood that I am having real problems that can’t be explained outside of my fucked up brain chemistry (after my suicide attempts he changed his mind and educated himself) Your fundamental flaw is that you have a surface-level understanding of mental issues/disorders/illnesses/ whatever and you’re letting the people you see on the internet form your world view of very complex and very debilitating experiences that real people have every day. 

If I were you I would consider yourself lucky that you aren’t really aware of how these things can ruin people’s (and their loved one’s) lives. Be aware that you have not had to experience them and be thankful for that, but also educate yourself on the realities of these things. I’m early to the thread, but you will soon see a huge swath of info on this thread that is not only personal experience, but data curated from years of research and testing. If you don’t get that, I’d go look into it yourself. If you’ve never been at a point where you’ve contemplated suicide, you’re lucky. The rest of us aren’t so lucky. 

I genuinely hope this helps at least a little bit.


Edit: nevermind. I just saw your second to last paragraph. Oh well. I will leave this up for those who come after. Have a good one

28 : ChickerNuggyComment: Each of the disorders you list exists in a spectrum, depression manifests in many different varieties; major depression, psychotic depression, postnatal depression, etc. Someone who has a lot of sad days probably doesn't need a doctor to tell them they have depression. Someone who gets noticeably, overactively nervous about things probably does have anxiety. 

The thing is most of us have issues on that spectrum because of how society is built, and that's why it's pathologized. Too many people start not enjoying life because of bad quality of life? Depressed. Too many people burning out at work or refusing to work for shit wages? Anxious and autistic. Too many people get the medical healthcare they want? Transgender. Too interested in the same sex? Homosexuality was a mental illness according to the DSM until 1987. And the people who wanted it to stay a mental illness are in their sixties and seventies, ruining our country one republican at a time. ADHD isn't something wrong with my brain, it's working exactly as it's trying to. It's a product of something pre-human, telling us to be aware of where our next meal might be in this forest or if those berries on the bush taste right. 

Times are anxious and depressing, paranoia inducing and traumatic. People are illegally getting snatched off the streets. The police system is a continuation of slavery. Corporations and politicians have enough overlap for Mussolini himself to call it fascism. Ignoring your natural instincts of danger as a human through "great coping mechanisms" truly should be the disorder. Our existence *is a neurological condition* and there is a lot of interest in medicating those hurt by these bad systems. You're right that a lot of people exaggerate how bad these conditions can be for them, but you ignore the number of people who downright suffer and the genuine reasons behind it. Sometimes it is something wrong with our brains. But sometimes it's genuinely just our brains responded as intended in a world that is rough. 

All too often, we tell people they always just need to stand back up and never address that we are constantly getting knocked down.

30 : Biscuit-of-the-CComment: What if these disorders are actually normal to the point that most ppl do have them?

31 : Meii345Comment: I mean, for starters people WOULD be better off getting therapy for every little thing. Therapy isn't just for serious ailments, it can help you be happier or have better relationships or deal with passing stresses or, yes, develop healthy coping skills for when you need them even if you feel okay in your day to day. I believe everyone should try going to therapy at least once in their lives no matter how good they feel about themselves. Just like you get annual GP checkups even if you feel fine; it's maintenance. 

Second point: Who is diagnosing themselves with depression because they feel sad sometimes or with anxiety because they're a tad anxious about public speaking? Riddle me this: Why would a perfectly happy, perfectly content, perfectly mentally sound person be seeking answers about what is wrong with them? I'll agree that sometimes those people are mistaken, sometimes what's up with them might not be PTSD but anxiety, but there IS a reason they want answers and help. And sure, to someone looking on from the outside it might just look like they're a bit sad sometimes, but for the person it might be "I can't find interest in any hobbies I used to like, I'm hopeless about the future". To an external pov it might look like "I'm anxious about public speaking" but to the person it might be "I'm hyperventilating at the idea of going up on stage, i'm injuring myself to get out of it, i keep turning over a conversation and all the ways it could have gone a million times a week after the fact and it's stopping me from sleeping"

The reality there is an actual problem, probably worthy of a diagnosis and is making those people's lives really, really unpleasant. So why can't they get help?

--------------------
32 : CurdKinComment: You have a common misconception that any feeling of sadness or anxiety is enough to diagnose depression or an anxiety disorder. 

In truth, to be diagnosed with these, as I have, you need to meet more requirements. You need to have these episodes a certain number of times in a certain period of time, and they also need to be affecting your ability to function and do every day tasks (among more as well). It’s not something that people who do not work with/have the disorders will understand. 

For example, I was diagnosed with Anxiety last year. Mind you, I have always been confident singing in public, public speaking, doing theatre, etc. the point is, I have ample experience pushing down my anxiety. When it came to a head last year, I was going through extreme stress in grad school, and was having trouble focusing. Little did I know, at the time, I was having trouble focusing because of my anxiety. It’s not a symptom you would expect anxiety to have, and, honestly, I did not feel anxious at the time. Now I am taking medications to help my anxiety and my studying habits increased tremendously and my grades have gone up a full letter in harder classes than I was taking before my anxiety diagnosis. 

My anxiety diagnosis has 100% improved the quality of my life, for 10$ a month on some pills that I’m not getting side effects from. 

As far as self-diagnosing issues? Yeah, that’s a problem. I was also convinced I had ADHD that’s why I sook out the medical professional last year and learned it was actually anxiety
--------------------
--------------------
33 : Alternative_Toe1309Comment: “Like, when did we decide that being sad sometimes means you have depression.” 

We haven’t. No legit medical professional would diagnose random sadness as clinical depression. That’s not what depression is. If this is your fundamental view then the onus is on you to educate yourself a bit first.
--------------------

34 : slinkys2Comment: Your examples are just wrong.

Everyone has anxiety. It's a normal human emotion. Sometimes, you get anxious before doing new or difficult things. 

Anxiety disorder is life altering. It's not, "Im getting nervous about this presentation."

It's, "Omg, my presentation is today. I prepped for 10 hours, but what if it wasn't enough? What if I forget it all? What if someone asks a question and i cant answer it? What if i forget how to talk altogether? What if it's so bad I get fired? Do I have enough in saving to cover rent for a few months and find a new job? What if I faint? Im gonna throw up. Omg im so dizzy. This is so pathetic. Im so embarrassing. Why cant i do this? I cant do this. I have to get out of this somehow. Why am I so hot? Its too hot. Im so dizzy.  Omg im about to shit my pants. What if I shit my pants? I cant breathe."

This is disordered thinking and absolutely isnt "normal human emotional." It typically requires therapy, putting in work, medication, or a lifestyle change to overcome. 

I think you're confusing someone experiencing anxiety, the emotion, and having an anxiety disorder. 

Likewise, I think the opposite of you. It's important to bring attention to this and let people know that disordered thinking *isnt* a normal human emotion, because it leads to millions of people disregarding thoughts and feelings that should be addressed by a professional as "normal."

36 : LordBecmiThacoComment: I'm in therapy and talk openly about being "depressed" with my therapist. I am depressed, which is a normal, non-pathologized human emotion. I still get up, go to work, see my friends, pay my bills and feed myself. My depression does not impede my day-to-day living; as such, my depression **does not meet any of the diagnostic criteria for a psychiatric or mental disorder**. I am depressed, but I do not have Major Depressive Disorder or General Anxiety Disorder, or anything else in the DSM-5.

The operative word is *disorder*. Everyone throughout the course of their life feels depressed, anxious, maybe even a bit narcissistic or antisocial at various points in their life. But the diagnostic criteria for everything a therapist or psychologist could diagnose you with requires the issue to be significantly impeding your life or lifestyle.



TLDR: You can be depressed without having a depressive disorder, and the same goes for most other mental ailments. It is a matter of degree; they have not pathologized depression, they have pathologized SEVERE depression, the kind of depression that makes people want to kill themselves or unable to get out of bed and fulfill their societal obligations; which are reasonable things to be pathologized and do genuinely warrant professional intervention or psychiatric medicine.

38 : hacksoncodeComment: &gt;Like, when did we decide that being sad sometimes means you have depression?

What, exactly and precisely, is the harm in saying this? So they say they're depressed. Now what? They either try to do something about it themselves, which is exactly what they'd do if they were just sad... or they go to a doctor, which is what they should do to find out if it's  actually a disorder.

Does talking shit about his *actually* hurt anyone at all in any way? I see exactly no evidence of this. People with real disorders actually still go to the doctor, and are actually still diagnosed and treated. 

I mean this view is kind of a catch-22... if they need help, the their self-diagnosis wasn't really wrong. If they don't need help, their self-diagnosis harms nothing and no one. 

So what if they talk about their being sad as being depressed? Does that change anything?

No. We still treat people with major depression, as a society, just like we ever did. It's not like people ever really talked about that stuff before socially *anyway*. 

Normalizing talking about it probably helps a few people, because if "it's just talking shit" no one is *stigmatizing* them... well... except you. Does *that* help people that really need help? Is your view *really* the problem?

39 : MakeHerUnderstandComment: Hi, so with how the world has developed the past decades, with technology and all, humans themselves have progressed —either more downward or upward whatever makes more sense —differently. You’ve seen people more distracted  than before, short term memory flicks (all thanks to the phones). This is a new kind of “human” humans have experienced, at least more than ever in this generation. Back in the days, mental disorders are reserved for those who are super on the spectrum, like psychosis or schizophrenia. Nowadays, there are spectrums where you can be on the fence for autism, anxiety, depression. It’s not a black and white picture (like it would be in the past) where a mental disorder is considered to be you’re sick or you’re not. Nowadays, the beauty of being on the spectrum on mental disorders mean you are not completely sane but still functional. And as you mention that “we are just humans.” That’s correct. Humans have issues, and now people are starting to latch on that a lot of people have issues. 

To give you an idea, a healthy minded person would be someone who doesn’t overthink, doesn’t stress that much, and live through life with a very strong mind. They don’t develop traits that cause them to feel like they’re going crazy. I only know a FEW amount of people who are like this or maybe at least they’re good enough to fake it. My partner for example, super stable. Came from a healthy family. Never had mental issues. 

However, nowadays most humans lack a healthy mindset. And the goal of defining mental disorders is to help people feel as normal as they want to feel. It doesn’t necessarily fix the generational crisis of mental health issues, but it certainly is a great way for healthcare companies to generate profits. It all comes in a circle. 

So, do mental disorders exist in most people? That’s debatable, hard to argued against and for. But is it annoying to see everyone having issues? Sure, but it’s none of our problems. The most important thing is we try our best to keep ourself sane without letting others influence us. Including that damn phone.

40 : Ania_Lost-LibraryComment: While it's true that we shouldn't pathologize every human emotion, recognizing and naming psychological struggles isn't making people weaker — it's empowering them. Emotions like sadness or anxiety are normal, but when they become persistent, intense, and disruptive, they may signal deeper issues that deserve attention. What some see as over-diagnosis may actually be long-overdue recognition of mental health needs that were historically ignored or stigmatized. Self-awareness doesn't undermine resilience; it builds it. And giving language to emotional pain — even “trauma” — isn’t about victimhood, but about healing.

In the end, acknowledging the complexity of human emotion doesn’t mean we’re broken — it means we’re finally listening. Striking the right balance between normal emotional experience and clinical concern is important, but dismissing growing mental health awareness as overreaction risks silencing those who genuinely need support. Recognizing pain is not weakness. It's the first step towards growth, resilience and genuine well being.

43 : rollsyrollsyComment: A nuance on your view: 

Language has been co-opted to describe events and scenarios much more broadly than their original meaning. 

Narcissism can be a mental health diagnosis. But it’s now more widely used, most often by women, to describe some guy who acted like a jerk. 

Abuse describes some fairly severe inflicting of harm by a perpetrator on a victim. But it’s now also used to describe dissatisfaction at anything in a relationship. 

Trauma is a meaningful negative event experienced by many people and a suitable cause for mental health therapy. It’s probably not just because the girl who was supposed to meet you for a date, stood you up. 

The fact that language has become anemic and lost its currency through misuse doesn’t mean that the original intended meaning isn’t actually true. Narcissists do exist. Abuse sadly happens. Trauma sadly exists as a real health issue. Just not as frequently as every Instagram comment would suggest.

44 : wakeupwillComment: There's a greater issue at hand, and that's that society is sick as a whole.

Where normal reactions to this unhealthy way of life are seen as a disorder. People are deemed divergent if they have a hard time adapting to a wholly inhospitable life balance.

a) Wider society not being sensitive or open enough to try to understand somebody with a very like advanced or powerful mind, and instead dismissing labelling insulting etc them

b) As you indicated, reactions to one's environment. Which are understandable and have explanation. 

Do I think ANY actual disorders may exist is there any kind of chemical imbalances and so on that maybe medication can effect? Perhaps but I'm actually mostly doubtful about it. I feel like therapy is too expensive and so nowadays we just force everyone onto drugs which we really don't completely understand how they work. Just take a read on any psychiatric medication and the list of possible effects it has will boggle you, it ranges wildly. So it's basically shots in the dark and trial and error. And to make pharma companies profits.

46 : VeniVidiWaluigiComment: When people are given language to describe things, they now have ways to put into words their experiences. Like all things, people *exaggerate* their experiences. 

When I was younger, people abused the word "literally" so much that it became this big online thing: "we're killing the English language by using words to mean the opposite of what they really mean!" All of this because people online and in schools were saying things like "If I don't get this good grade, I'll literally have an aneurysm!" 

Using words incorrectly to express emotions is pretty standard, especially for young people, and it's always cluttered genuine expression. I don't see it as pernicious or anything, but I do think people that speak like that will eventually learn that doing a chore isn't "trauma" when they have to deal with a person that has real PTSD or some such trauma.

47 : cooliovonhoolioComment: The DSM-V provides diagnostic criteria for mental health conditions. Being sad “sometimes” would not satisfy the criteria for depression, being nervous before an important presentation would not be diagnosed as an anxiety disorder, being appropriately distracted would not be diagnosed as ADHD. 

The problem a lot of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists are seeing is that people are self-diagnosing and then coming in to see a professional, already under the impression that they are diagnosed. This has caused a substantial workload increase and frustration in the professional communities. 

I think your confusion here may be between self-diagnosis and over-diagnosis? Regardless, what you are claiming is factually incorrect.

48 : expolifeComment: I wonder if what this post is about on a deeper level is learned helplessness or maybe experiencing enough neglect and lack of connection to seek a problem that warrants attention. On some level I think this is connection seeking behavior or a way of diminishing feelings of shame that people don’t have sufficient compassion to metabolize fully. 
Resilience isn’t just a skill, it’s something a community of connection and modeling supports developmentally. People will totally lean into whatever helps them cope including an accepted self-diagnosis. At the end of the day, I think mental health is relational health. And the formal medical establishment in the US is barely beginning to acknowledge the many forms of complex trauma, CPTSD, and neglect for emotional health and relational connection. I agree that pathologizing natural human experience and emotional function can be extremely damaging, but what’s normal in society and families in many ways are very toxic traits, emotional illiteracy, and relational dysfunction. The step towards accepting neurodivergence and de stigmatizing it seems like a beneficial step towards therapy and cultural change as long as we don’t get bogged down in exclusively pursuing pharma solutions that create further dependencies.

49 : HeroBrine0907Comment: You mentioned self diagnosis. The medical field doesn't do anything about that. 

We don't think being sad is an issue. Depression is not sadness. Depression actively causes major issues in normal day to day life.

Do you think an emotion should be normlal causing people's lives to have major issues which don't occur for most of the population? Just random emotions becoming a huge obstacle to basic human functioning? That is not normal. Which is why we study them, fix them.

Self diagnosis means about as much to actual disorders, and mental issues as a person on the internet who read a wiki article and claimed to solve quantum gravity.

50 : Zealousideal-Bet6397Comment: I also just want to say that what’s trauma for one person isn’t trauma for the next. Every human is different and so yes how people talk to you and how you’re treated can be traumatic depending on the situation. Self diagnosis is never okay. Seasonal and situational depression is a real thing. But more importantly I think it’s all just a trend. It’s not in our nature to be precise with our language “I’m dying” “I’m going to pass out” “I’m starving” “I’m depressed”  are things that are thrown around when more likely than not it’s not as heavy or intense as the word they’re using to describe it.

51 : the-apple-and-omegaComment: &gt;My little cousin told me last week that she thinks she has ADHD because she gets distracted during boring classes. I'm like... yeah, that's called being a teenager in algebra class, not a neurological condition. But now she's convinced there's something wrong with her brain instead of just accepting that some stuff is tedious.

I mean, that's self-diagnosing which is an entirely different issue. There's zero question people's brains handle the situation you're describing differently though, and that society is structured only for people who handle it the preferred way, hence the "neurodivergent" designation.

52 : Material-Surprise-72Comment: Who do you mean by “we” in this situation? 

Because I don’t think most professionals are doing this, but the public is. This is actually being discussed as a concern among professionals.

Especially since a lot of what you’re talking about are examples of misinformation. Just because you can read a criteria list does not mean you are qualified to contextualize it or perform assessments related to establishing the criteria.

But your argument sounds similar to an argument people will make for getting rid of the DSM - which I think is a very “baby and the bath water” situation.

53 : CompromiseeComment: I agree with you tbf

I thought more people would have resonated with that, seems to have been a huge thing over the last 5 years.

At some point ADHD and Autism became a trendy thing to have and now so many people "have it". People in the comments saying they aren't seeing it, so many people in my work and personal life are saying they've got something, I don't know how it could be missed. 

As a parent to young kids, so many other parents saying their kids have ADHD or Autism. A couple saying they think their kids have ADHD because they have too much energy - yeah they're children....

54 : danguyfComment: Every disorder is a normal human condition taken to a disordered extreme. It makes sense, then, and is helpful to have a term for each disordered extreme so that people can better articulate their thoughts and feelings. 


The drawback is people's tendency to self-diagnose or to try to show sympathy by claiming that they too feel or do X when their X is not the extreme version. This can feel minimizing to sufferers and strike people such as yourself as absurd, which is valid. 


Medical practitioners, thankfully, are not so loose with their terminology and diagnoses.

55 : ShalrakComment: Going to therapy IS learning coping skills. That's the purpose of therapy. I'm not sure why you set up learning normal coping skills as an alternative to therapy. 

Emotions are complicated, especially our own, and most skills are learned best with the help of a specialist. We don't all *need* therapy, but it can be beneficial to everyone, whether we have a disorder or not. 

We don't have to handle everyone on our own just because we can. The fact that seeking professional help is becoming more normalised in our society is not a negative thing.

56 : HEpennypackerNHComment: I knew from that title that you were going to say depression is just being sad.

The only way to change your view is to tell you you do not understand what depression is.

--------------------
--------------------
57 : caelit31Comment: The way I see these mental health conditions is more about a categorization of how your brain chemistry responds in various situations. Sometimes simply understanding that, can help the individual and the people they are interacting with realize that the emotions we feel are a response to how are brain is processing the information (either correctly or incorrectly). And when our reactions and responses become too extreme (perhaps in a spiral), understanding that can also help plan a sustainable path to return.

58 : 16carComment: We didn't, and there's no valid reason for your opinion that we need. Every mental health condition has formal diagnostic criteria, and exclusion criteria. **One of the diagnostic criteria for every mental illness is that it is outside the normal range of human experience, AND is having a significant impact on the person's social and occupational functioning.** (In this context "occupation" means "normal activities," including but not limited to, paid employment.)

--------------------
59 : c0d3rmanComment: If you think "being sad sometimes" or "having a bad day" or "being sad because sad things happened" is what people mean when they say they have depression, then I'm sorry, but you just don't know what depression is.

One of the very important things about recognizing depression as a mental health condition was making it clear that it is *not* just normal temporary uncomfortable emotion, and that "coping" is not sufficient to deal with it.

Yes, obviously some people say they have depression when they don't. Some people also say they have cancer when they don't. But the thing that actually makes it harder for people with mental health conditions to be taken seriously is when people liken those mental health conditions to mundane sadness. They are qualitatively different things. Likening depression to having a bad day is like likening a gaping hole in your gas tank to being out of gas.
--------------------
--------------------
60 : ethical_arsonistComment: Normal human condition + modern society = mental health condition.

The solution to that is not to tell people (especially young people) with mental health conditions that everyone else deals fine with what they're moaning about.

The solution is massive reform of society to make it less individualistic and high-pressure and more community-based. 

Until that happens, let your niece have support for her ADHD symptoms.
--------------------

61 : NoBear609Comment: Sort of agree. Diagnosing conditions is necessary for treatment and can be difficult these days, but I'm very skeptical that psychopathology has any meaningful contribution to healthcare. I don't see any use in labeling certain personalities disordered because nobody is a disease. I hate when people act like their condition is their personality because it's ignorant of the real factors that contribute to one's health.  
  
You mention the conditions that many people have though, which I don't think is the problem. We need to be talking *more* about the rates of depression, anxiety, and other conditions. If that's the language we need for mental health to be taken seriously by the insurance industry, so be it. They make much more money from treating incurable disorders than actually doing progressive treatments, so the discourse in academia is often skewed towards pathologizing our daily lives. It's a sleight of hand, basically. You make some good points but also say that our focus on mental health and trauma is somehow making people worse. Idk, that doesn't add up.

62 : Shewhomust77Comment: What you mean ‘we’? Some “influencers” and the ignorant may throw these terms around as hypochondriacs throw around ‘cancer’ and ‘gastritis’ and all.

Granted, psychology is way behind medicine, but again, that doesnt mean there is no distinction between normal human behavior and painful and sometimes lethal illness.

63 : Thin-Management-1960Comment: My my. You’re on the cusp of a genuine revelation, aren’t you? But you just aren’t digging deep enough yet! You are too caught up in the realm of your own frustration. Why? Ah…Because you are seeking relief.

In other words, you don’t actually believe that these things are wrong, do you? You simply *eagerly desire* for them to be wrong, so that you can force them into compliance with the worldview you find most comforting. Am I right?

If I am right, that would mean that you are not seeking to have someone change your view, but seeking to invite others to judge whether or not this, your hope, your ideal, is actually a wish within reason, or an impossible dream.

So…what is my perspective then? Well, for the sake of the comment, I must disagree…it is an unrealistic dream.

But that is only because you did not wish for the proper setting in advance of this dream.

Allow me to help you establish this, your dream space, and in doing so, earn the right to change your view by means of enhancing your vision.

What you must wish for is this: that all technical terminology and understanding be removed from the realm of general understanding. Why? Because technically understanding and general understanding are oil and water. They do not mix well, and the forced emulsion is a confusion, regardless of how delicious it tastes... 🤤 

*Ahem* as I was saying…

Technical knowledge is meant to serve only within a particular realm. These realms we call “fields”, and they are essentially pocket realities we manifest in thought in order to freely apply rules and principles to shape what is true and false within that realm—an ability that does not translate into reality, the general realm.

To put it simply, fields of study are fairytales created to convey concepts using imaginary objects, and it is necessitated by the need to make those objects do things that objects in reality cannot do.

For example, within a certain field, an object might “tell” you something about the world, whereas in reality, objects do not tell. This personification is a means of allowing us to communicate with our surroundings, but not in reality! Only in fantasy. The idea behind the field is *not* to pretend as though the fantasy things are real, but to immerse our minds in the fantasy in order to enhance our real-life behaviors. In other words: to act.

The best way to envision these fields are like overlays. How is it that some people confuse these overlays for plain reality? The point of confusion is the point of commonality between the real world and the fantasy: our language.

Yes, language is the culprit. Language is to blame. In what way? In the same way a wolf in a fantasy tale might confuse people who have never encountered a wolf into thinking they know something about wolves after reading the fantasy story! In just this way! People absorb technical knowledge while failing to understand that it was never meant to be real or representative of reality. It was always meant to alter reality for the one immersed within it, but to return them to reality when they stop thinking through that particular lens.

So look back at what you are upset about, and see with new eyes. The issue isn’t that people are obsessed with wolves. It’s that the fantasy tale describes wolves as small rodents, so now people actually genuinely believe that their cage of mice is a den of wolves. The cure? Easy. You expose the confusion: two terms that are identical but have different meanings: “wolf” (in the fantasy) and “wolf” (in reality). When people understand that these are two different terms describing two different things? Then your dream space will be complete, and your dream will finally have a chance at becoming your actuality, not in fact, but in form, an overlay that is a perfect fit.

If I were the master of humans, I’d make it so that all fields be required to have their own languages. This would alleviate confusion. Take Mathematics for instance. Can you imagine if the number 1 was called “I” and the number 2 was called “you”? People would be walking around saying “I always come before you!” 😂 The powerful way these confusions impact our society is truly astounding.

I hope that this is helpful. 🙏

if humanity were to be extinct, i would much prefer a monster. maybe then, we would all feel a little more contempt. a little less hate, and a little more acceptance as we can do nothing but watch as the beast tears through cities and towns, knowing your country will be soon next. at least maybe then the world would cooperate for once. 

or maybe not. countries being nuked. war crimes. chaos. cults worshipping the monster. militaries killing civilians on sight to deter from refugee zones. but the idea of a slow approaching, unstoppable beast that will stop at nothing is a very, very romantical idea. the idea that nothing will stop it, so why not accept it? take pictures of the world. write. draw. film. maybe when we realize all this money saved, all this time commiting to political sides, all this nonsense of pondering about corruption and the problems of both capitalism, communism, socialism, fascism- when everything gets deduced down to "it won't exist in a month," nothing really matters anymore. no more suffering. no more new children to be harmed. 

and maybe i like this idea of tearing down the world apart. we can start a new one.
--------------------
1 : destro23Comment: &gt;at least maybe then the world would cooperate for once.

We just had a monster tearing though the global population; Covid. The world didn't cooperate *at all*. 

Lets ignore that giant monsters are not real for a moment, and look at how the people of the world respond to global threats. They do not cooperate. Some try to fix it. Some ignore it. And some try to capitalize on it. It would be the same if there were a monster. It would be the same if it were zombies. It would be the same if it were aliens. 

Some humans are always going to take advantage of a situation to enrich themselves. This will remain true even if the situations is an existential crisis. 

Look at climate change. That is just a giant weather monster that is rampaging around, causing death and destruction, and that one day might just kill us all. Most people don't even give a shit, and a lot of people actively deny that it is even a thing to be worried about. 

If there were a giant monster fucking up Nairobi, a fair portion of the world would claim it was a fake attack, and the monster wasn't real. And, a fair portion would be actively cheering for the monster.

2 : jedi_treyComment: I don't think a single 200m monster could wipe out every human.  Oceans and distance not withstanding, people can just hide underground or in small areas the monster cant access.   If the monster chills in one spot, just move.  If the monster is constantly moving then just hide when it's around and live your life when it's not.

5 : JOKU1990Comment: Great CMV. I’ve thought about this before about dinosaurs or something. Zombies etc. only thing is that we can’t understand fear surrounding those things. We can semi understand fear of man. 

So we know that certain environments or situations regarding humans are scary. For some people, they have been in those situations so they truly understand but for most we just leave that to our imaginations. 

So it’s easy to say it would be better if there was a 200m beast crushing everyone now. But if you saw that beast rip your friend to pieces or burn them alive slowly or crush your family in a car then you may not think that.

I would assume that civilization would continue for a while. Like if it was one day and the monster would take everyone out then that’s one thing but I imagine it would be more like walking dead. People would escape to the mountains and live in hiding. Then die slowly while developing cults. The longer is takes for the monster to take everyone out, the more likely civilization with revert right back to crime.

we'd feel nothing because we'd all be dead.  We would not cooperate because we'd all be dead.

Except we'd probably not go extinct from an event like this.  I am to an ant as Godzilla is to me.  And we have not driven ants extinct. 

Even if Godzilla got all his calories from eating people we'd be fine. he would needs about 100 million daily.  Assuming 600 calories per pound of human and an average weight of 100 pounds, Godzilla needs to eat about 1,600 people per day.  there are 360,000 babies born every day.  we breed way faster then he can eat us.
