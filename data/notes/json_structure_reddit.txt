I am not talking about his actions in terms of his policy, rather I'm referencing how he acts as a person.\n\n1. **He's far more interested in sewing division than actually bringing unity to the other party and dissenters:** He's repeatedly calls Democrats as crooks with no basis, he calls the press the \"Enemy of the people\" when they have the audacity to report the truth on him, and he lumps any mild rhetoric against him as the \"The Extreme Left\". He's the least bipartisan president we've had in a century. Don't worry though, there's plenty of accusations to go around, if you are a Republican challenging his polices he'll call you a traitorous RINO, never mind that he's the biggest RINO in existence.\n\n2.  **There is no \"agree to disagree\"**: Kind of tying to the first point but it seems like he can never just let go of things. To him he either likes you because you're doing something for him, or he hates you because you're not. And it can flip on a dime. He famously called McCain a loser after his death just because of policy disagreements, he mocked Faucci repeatedly at his rallies, and then there's the recent Elon Musk fallout. And then there's the whole Election Fraud claims of course.\n\n3. **He values loyalty over expertise:** I dont even want to get into how dangerous this as a concept for this country, but what this also tells me is that Donald has no faith bring able to lead with personal yes men. In order to be a leader you have to accept that not everyone is going to be on your side 100% of the time. Yet this guy cant even be bothered to even try to convince people why what he's doing is good. He'd rather do a purity test and fire qualified people because it hurts his feelings.\n\n4. **He doesn't know how to handle problems without threat of force (Cutting funds, EO's, or straight up using the military):** For someone who's claims to be a successful businessman, this dude straight up sucks at negotiating. For example, even if I were to believe that single one of our allies is screwing us over in trade, what good does it do to pass off our allies by insulting but more importantly threatening then with economic or military force. He also constantly escalates to either threatening or using violence. \"When the looting starts the shooting starts.\" All this does is escalate tensions, and everyone, including people in his first administration tries tl tell him this but he just ignores it. If I have one point to make in all of this post is this: If you have to constantly use force as a way to get what you want, you're a dogshit leader.\n\n5. **There is literally no empathy:** To me one of the most defining moments of Trump's character on video is after the DC crash one of the the reporters asked if he'll visit the crash site. A pretty innocuous question. He gets flippant and says \"What am I going to do, swim?\" Say whatever you want about Biden's mental state, but even in Biden's supposed confusion, he would definitely be able to try to say something positive, unifying, and presidential. It's indicative of his character. Trump can't even be bothered to even lie and say something nice on camera and just not follow through on it. Let's not also forget that with this same incident he said the crash was a result of DEI *before the bodies were even cold.* He takes no accountability and has no regard for anybody who isnt himself. He's far mpre concerned eith how he is viewed as president than the actual work needed to be viewed as such.\n\nIf anybody can provide examples of him being a good leader for people who dont innately praise him im open to changing my view.",

Even when they are held accountable and lose their job over their misconduct, they can just move over to another county, town, etc and become a cop and the fact they got fired from their previous police department might not even come up on their background check. If it did, it probably wouldn't matter. If a cop gets fired for any kind of misconduct such as a wrongful arrest, civil rights violation, police brutality, etc he/she should have their name go on a state wide registry. That way, if he/she were to apply for another cop position within the state their name will pop up as a red flag and no department in the state should be allowed to hire that person. That person would have to move to another state in order to become a cop. It may sound extreme but something like this would make cops think twice before they do something to violate the rights of citizens. ",

They basically have unlimited power and are rarely held accountable no matter what they do or who they hurt. Even when they are held accountable and lose their job over their misconduct, they can just move over to another county, town, etc and become a cop and the fact they got fired from their previous police department might not even come up on their background check. If it did, it probably wouldn&amp;#39;t matter. If a cop gets fired for any kind of misconduct such as a wrongful arrest, civil rights violation, police brutality, etc he/she should have their name go on a state wide registry. That way, if he/she were to apply for another cop position within the state their name will pop up as a red flag and no department in the state should be allowed to hire that person. That person would have to move to another state in order to become a cop. It may sound extreme but something like this would make cops think twice before they do something to violate the rights of citizens. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "The whole Musk-Trump blowup honestly felt inevitable. From the outside, it might’ve looked like a power duo - two guys who love disruption and attention teaming up to reshape things. But if you look closer, it was always a mismatch in vision.\n\n\n\nMusk operates like a systems guy. Whether it's rockets, EVs, or platforms like X, he’s obsessed with optimising from the ground up. So when he got looped into this whole “government efficiency” gig, it made sense - he probably saw it as a rare shot to fix the machine instead of just criticizing it.\n\n\n\nBut Trump? He’s not a systems builder. He’s a showman. His game has always been optics and momentum - big announcements, base-pleasing slogans, loyalty above logic. So the second he rolled out that giant spending bill, it wasn't just policy friction.

          "selftext": "**TLDR; I believe we're gonna be fine lol**\n\nThe narrative that America (or as some agitators like to call, the \"aMeRiCaN EmPiRe\") is \"collapsing\" or \"dying\" has been floating around for a few years now, mostly in polarized social media spaces detached from reality, and mostly in response to the rise of Trump, the greater conservative populist movement, and political polarity. At first, I just found it annoying because I don't think doom and gloom helps anyone who isn't trying to gain from the message, and that hope is always a better avenue. But I have now come to the belief that the idea isn't just annoying, it's historically blatantly untrue and will remain untrue. Still, I want to know why my reasoning might not hold true, and not just \"can't predict the future!\"\n\nMy reasoning stems from the idea that this country has made it through *WAY* worse than anything we've seen in the last decade. The saying may be cliche, but I genuinely stand by it when viewing history, both domestically and abroad. America signed the Dec. of Independence in 1776, and was able to begin operating as its own country after the revolutionary war in 1783, so I'm going to be viewing from that year on afterwards.\n\n**I'll begin by looking domestically**. These are the 3 biggest events in my opinion that our nation went through which genuinely had true and full potential to end the country as people knew it:\n\n1. The War of 1812. The British Empire trying to regain what they had lost is genuinely horrifying if you think about it. Imagine gaining independence only to have to fight off the very same oppressive totalitarian aggressor *again* just to keep it. That doesn't usually happen in history, where instead one of 3 things normally happen: conquered territory is never relinquished and forever altered, territory is never conquered, or territory is conquered, but then freed from that specific aggressor forever. We had to engage the very same aggressor, as if Britain could not fathom the idea that it did not have a right to our nation. I feel like the War of 1812 isn't talked about enough because it's the only war since our Revolution where America, as a whole, had to fight another nation not for its benefit or revenge, but for its total survival. But we did it and made it through.\n2. Confederacy and Civil War. Self explanatory; country actually did split and resulted in the deadliest war in American history by American casualties because it was Americans fighting Americans. Civil wars normally end in either one side's victory, or permanent fraction. We came out with the former and moved on.\n3. Great Depression. America had become one with its industry and industry economy at this point, so what the Great Depression had the potential to do was basically never let us come back. But we came back and moved on (love you FDR).\n\nBefore I continue, there were two other events I considered but decided against, and I want to address:\n\n* Chattel slavery. It was horrific and the poster child of the humans rights abuses this country was physically founded upon (in conjunction with native genocide), and we must continue to learn from history. However, for this post, I must look at numbers: since 1783, African Americans, slaves or free, were never majority of the people in the nation's entirety (not talking about specific states where they actually were at some points). At its peak in 1860, slavery accounted for 4M people, with the total population being around 31.5M. Today, AA's make up 13% of the population. In my opinion, while slavery anywhere is a great argument for QOL and human/civil rights measures, you can't determine the future health/continuation of a nation based on the ill of a genuine numerical minority.\n* COVID. Obviously a terrible disaster and may all those affected find health and peace. But when viewing numbers, it took a greater toll on well being and emotional health than it did actual stability. Numbers wise, population was barely scratched (around 1.2M out of around 330M). And while the economy clearly tanked and we will be facing countless problems (mostly mental) in the future because of COVID, we came out pretty well given this was the modern day plague and the world began by having 0 counter. The lockdowns sucked and in 1929, they might have ended us. But this time we had technology and it was honestly that which saved our economy from total collapse like what happened in the GD, and also the reason why despite the economy tanking overall, unlike the GD, there were economic increases in many distinct places too (ex: Zoom).\n\nSince the GD, almost everything America has been involved with regarding our health as a nation has been domestic civil political unrest and conflicts abroad, so ones not on American soil, and thus not ones that really threatened the nation's people's lives and thus the nation's continuation. Cold War was terrifying yes, but it didn't amount to shit. Worst artificial attacks against explicitly American life since the civil war (I count COVID as a disease that the whole world had to fight) were Pearl Harbor and 9/11, and while tragic, made us stronger pretty much immediately.\n\nSo with the 3 major domestic events above, plus all the major abroad ones and all the littler events in mind, where are we now? A nation around 250 years old (so a a fetus) that has, ballpark, 80%+ of the same civil rights (free speech, worker's rights, women's and racial minority vote and participation, LGBTQ marriage, free practice of religion, etc) as developed and socially progressed nations thousands and thousands of years older than us, enshrined into our law. Practice can be argued to be a different story, and there's always room to improve in every nation, but the recognition of the rights on paper in federal law is what is most important and marks how people will be viewed by the government from there on out; as African Americans were known to say, \"freedom comes first.\" And America has been the world leader in military might, economy, technology, and volume of higher education for quite a while now. If we weathered all of that first sentence, and still come out to this degree of historical progress in comparison to other nations, and at the stupidly young age we're at, I find it very hard to believe we're just \"done for\" because of one guy in 8 broken up years. Until we hit events that have the danger scale of the 3 I mentioned (no, social media echo chambers fear mongering about a civil war don't count), I believe our history shows we will be fine.\n\nSo now to address fears of Trump's government, its perceived erosion of democracy and stability, and any fears of future all out authoritarianism. I may dislike throwing terms like \"fascism\" around. But I do not like Trump (for a plethora of reasons) and think that some of his ideas, at their worst, are directly un-American, and thus I want to validate peoples concerns and address them. I'm going begin by looking globally, then swing back domestically again:\n\n1. I'll begin with *the* example of fascism, Germany. And actually, this doesn't need much explanation. The time gap between Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s and modern day Germany in 2025 is basically a second historically, not even 100 years. Germany didn't just have fears of fascism, they slid directly into it and became *the* case example studied everywhere. Look at where they're at now. Those same major cities, Berlin, Frankfurt, etc are still there. Borders of core German area are still in tact and pretty much as they were prior Austria's annexation. Population increased. And economy and industry, while only revived because of help at first, is now one of the best in the world. So we know for a definitive fact beyond all fear mongering, reasonable doubt, and hopelessness that even when the worst actually literally does come to worst, a nation can come back, prevail, and exist and thrive in the future. No American in the last 100 years has lived under a government that came even close to what Hitler's became. Next.\n2. China. Again, it's a pretty open and shut argument. What Mao did to his population in numbers makes anything that Hitler, Leopold, and Stalin did, numbers wise, look elementary. The consensus estimate is 15-55M of deaths, with the number 40M being used quite a bit. In other words, too many to actually count. And yet this happened in 1950-60s, and we're in 2025, so an even *shorter* time gap than Germany. Where is China now? Well, this writing is about continued survival of nations, which is dependent on stability and human life. It's not about non-lethal civil rights abuses. I may despise the Chinese government, but in modern day, there are two nations who objectively lead the world in military might and industry. China is one of them. Given what Mao did not even 80 years earlier, that's impressive.\n\nReturning domestically, I'll look at political unrest since the Civil War, beginning with riots. I'll be bias very quickly: the current LA protests are just. But the LA riots are pretty scary. That latter view is shared by pretty much everyone, ranging from \"hey we can protest the ICE raids peacefully without vandalism or waving the Mexican flag\" all the way to flat out racism. We all hate seeing what's happening.\n\nBut what I find almost ridiculous is that these riots in the last 5 years, whether they be for Floyd or Gaza or immigrants, are somehow being used to say \"yeah we're done.\" The summer of 2020 was bad (Minnesotan here, saw it myself). But I don't think anything has happened in the 21st century on American soil with regards to civil unrest that is on par with what we saw in the 20th century; Rodney King, Red Summer, Vietnam demo.'s, Black Panther party, and peaceful MLK demonstrations are all examples off the top of my head. And yet here we are; America is not going to die because of civil unrest lol.\n\nNext, fears of \"life is gonna be shit because \\[\\*insert political group I disagree with\\*\\] is in power.\" Life is tough lol ofc. But as America keeps progressing at an unparalleled rate compared to the ages of other countries, I think there's a pretty simple reason that riots and civil unrest are becoming less intense and frequent (e.g. 21st vs 20th century): despite any narrative, shit has actually improved for everyone. Yes, as has been the case since America's founding, white people have dominantly reaped the greatest and most improvements in QOL because: a) numbers, as they've always been the largest racial demographic and b) first direct, then systemic racism. But QOL is measured as an average of all, and we do not live in an apartheid state like 20th century South Africa or India, so any improvements in QOL are felt by all, whether it be civil rights, tech, medicine (like vaccines), etc, just in varying quantities. If you ask most racial minorities in this country if they've encountered racism, experienced hardships, or feel like they have ever been treated unfairly, I think most will understandably answer yes. But if you ask those same people (especially the largest two minority demographics, African and Hispanic Americans) whether they genuinely want to leave America or be \"rescued,\" most will answer no, and that isn't just because of \"mUh FrEeDoM.\" And ignoring race, we can look at general political sentiment too. Right now, Red is in power, so majority Blue states don't love it; que the vice versa and same pattern happening for every administration since at least the 20th century and in the future. But even in [r/LosAngeles](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/) right now, you have people in the same comment section slandering ICE *an*d downvoting comments that promote Cali ceding from the US. This is not the first time political tensions have been high asf post-civil war, and will not be the last. But none of this has ever been enough to truly end us, or have the majority of people to say \"yeah screw the united country.\"\n\nLast, I will look at the relationship of the American government and political stability:\n\n1. Starting with an easy one, SCOTUS. Any attempt to use SCOTUS's perceived political leaning as reason for \"welp there goes democracy\" is ignorant and historically blind imo. SCOTUS has *always* ocellated in political ideology since its inception. It has made many terrible judgements. It is also the reason why we have gay marriage, desegregated schools, and worker's rights. Again, the question remains the same: since SCOTUS's inception, where are we now? I'd argue we are way better off now than where we were before the first court presided. The idea that SCOTUS needs to be \"packed\" to save its integrity because some people don't like the current court's perceived political leaning is both inconsistent and absurd. SCOTUS is not a good indicator of collapse.\n   * I can give you a good example with the current court: perceived conservative majority, 6/9 justices being picks by current party (3/9 by current president here too) in power. And yet, since current presidential term began, it is the judicial branch led by SCOTUS that has halted Trump the most, and this has included SCOTUS directly. This court has both granted Trump wins, *and* handed unanimous losses; ACB, Trump's latest pick, just shredded his own lawyer two weeks ago. SCOTUS will most likely always be SCOTUS.\n2. *This is not the first time* America has had a \"wtf\" administration, or one perceived to be terrible for the people. A few of them happened leading up to the Civil War, and then ones that failed reconstruction. Then there was Hoover to whom the entire population said \"nah this is ass what's the other option.\" But then there's also, among others, Nixon, whose was well into the 20th century. And he fucked up enough to where he was actually gonna be the first ever to be removed from office if he didn't high tail it out of there. We were fine after those presidents, we will be fine after this one.\n\nFinally, and I may get hate for this, but 2A. 2A wasn't put in the constitution for no reason. I highly doubt right now that we will ever see its implied overarching purpose utilized, but who knows. Regardless, while never seen before, the same amendment that grants America a unique problem (gun violence) is the very reason that, beyond our military, we are nearly impossible to invade by external nations, or be tyrannized by our own. No civilian population has ever in the history of the world been as armed as the American one is. It's also one of many things where party doesn't matter, as guns are owned across the board. There is no world in which the military will want to engage with the genuine American population (we're not talking riots here lol, barely anyone attends those). Technologically we'd get creamed sure, but that's only possible with mass casualties; bombs primarily. And I think you will be hard pressed to find anyone in the military who will actually follow a \"bomb your fellow civilian on your own soil\" order. So that leaves direct gunfire combat, which is dangerous for everyone involved, and law enforcement and military know this. And none of this considers fractions in the military and law enforcement.\n\nSo to summarize, given what America has pushed through, and given examples of external situations America hasn't experienced, and given current behavior and numbers, I can't see why America will collapse despite things being challenging atm. I'm open to both being given genuine reasons as to why it could, and being convinced it will.",

At first, I just found it annoying because I don&amp;#39;t think doom and gloom helps anyone who isn&amp;#39;t trying to gain from the message, and that hope is always a better avenue. But I have now come to the belief that the idea isn&amp;#39;t just annoying, it&amp;#39;s historically blatantly untrue and will remain untrue. Still, I want to know why my reasoning might not hold true, and not just &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t predict the future!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My reasoning stems from the idea that this country has made it through &lt;em&gt;WAY&lt;/em&gt; worse than anything we&amp;#39;ve seen in the last decade. The saying may be cliche, but I genuinely stand by it when viewing history, both domestically and abroad. America signed the Dec. of Independence in 1776, and was able to begin operating as its own country after the revolutionary war in 1783, so I&amp;#39;m going to be viewing from that year on afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;ll begin by looking domestically&lt;/strong&gt;. These are the 3 biggest events in my opinion that our nation went through which genuinely had true and full potential to end the country as people knew it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The War of 1812. The British Empire trying to regain what they had lost is genuinely horrifying if you think about it. Imagine gaining independence only to have to fight off the very same oppressive totalitarian aggressor &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; just to keep it. That doesn&amp;#39;t usually happen in history, where instead one of 3 things normally happen: conquered territory is never relinquished and forever altered, territory is never conquered, or territory is conquered, but then freed from that specific aggressor forever. We had to engage the very same aggressor, as if Britain could not fathom the idea that it did not have a right to our nation. I feel like the War of 1812 isn&amp;#39;t talked about enough because it&amp;#39;s the only war since our Revolution where America, as a whole, had to fight another nation not for its benefit or revenge, but for its total survival. But we did it and made it through.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Confederacy and Civil War. Self explanatory; country actually did split and resulted in the deadliest war in American history by American casualties because it was Americans fighting Americans. Civil wars normally end in either one side&amp;#39;s victory, or permanent fraction. We came out with the former and moved on.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Great Depression. America had become one with its industry and industry economy at this point, so what the Great Depression had the potential to do was basically never let us come back. But we came back and moved on (love you FDR).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I continue, there were two other events I considered but decided against, and I want to address:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Chattel slavery. It was horrific and the poster child of the humans rights abuses this country was physically founded upon (in conjunction with native genocide), and we must continue to learn from history. However, for this post, I must look at numbers: since 1783, African Americans, slaves or free, were never majority of the people in the nation&amp;#39;s entirety (not talking about specific states where they actually were at some points). At its peak in 1860, slavery accounted for 4M people, with the total population being around 31.5M. Today, AA&amp;#39;s make up 13% of the population. In my opinion, while slavery anywhere is a great argument for QOL and human/civil rights measures, you can&amp;#39;t determine the future health/continuation of a nation based on the ill of a genuine numerical minority.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;COVID. Obviously a terrible disaster and may all those affected find health and peace. But when viewing numbers, it took a greater toll on well being and emotional health than it did actual stability. Numbers wise, population was barely scratched (around 1.2M out of around 330M). And while the economy clearly tanked and we will be facing countless problems (mostly mental) in the future because of COVID, we came out pretty well given this was the modern day plague and the world began by having 0 counter. The lockdowns sucked and in 1929, they might have ended us. But this time we had technology and it was honestly that which saved our economy from total collapse like what happened in the GD, and also the reason why despite the economy tanking overall, unlike the GD, there were economic increases in many distinct places too (ex: Zoom).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the GD, almost everything America has been involved with regarding our health as a nation has been domestic civil political unrest and conflicts abroad, so ones not on American soil, and thus not ones that really threatened the nation&amp;#39;s people&amp;#39;s lives and thus the nation&amp;#39;s continuation. Cold War was terrifying yes, but it didn&amp;#39;t amount to shit. Worst artificial attacks against explicitly American life since the civil war (I count COVID as a disease that the whole world had to fight) were Pearl Harbor and 9/11, and while tragic, made us stronger pretty much immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So with the 3 major domestic events above, plus all the major abroad ones and all the littler events in mind, where are we now? A nation around 250 years old (so a a fetus) that has, ballpark, 80%+ of the same civil rights (free speech, worker&amp;#39;s rights, women&amp;#39;s and racial minority vote and participation, LGBTQ marriage, free practice of religion, etc) as developed and socially progressed nations thousands and thousands of years older than us, enshrined into our law. Practice can be argued to be a different story, and there&amp;#39;s always room to improve in every nation, but the recognition of the rights on paper in federal law is what is most important and marks how people will be viewed by the government from there on out; as African Americans were known to say, &amp;quot;freedom comes first.&amp;quot; And America has been the world leader in military might, economy, technology, and volume of higher education for quite a while now. If we weathered all of that first sentence, and still come out to this degree of historical progress in comparison to other nations, and at the stupidly young age we&amp;#39;re at, I find it very hard to believe we&amp;#39;re just &amp;quot;done for&amp;quot; because of one guy in 8 broken up years. Until we hit events that have the danger scale of the 3 I mentioned (no, social media echo chambers fear mongering about a civil war don&amp;#39;t count), I believe our history shows we will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now to address fears of Trump&amp;#39;s government, its perceived erosion of democracy and stability, and any fears of future all out authoritarianism. I may dislike throwing terms like &amp;quot;fascism&amp;quot; around. But I do not like Trump (for a plethora of reasons) and think that some of his ideas, at their worst, are directly un-American, and thus I want to validate peoples concerns and address them. I&amp;#39;m going begin by looking globally, then swing back domestically again:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;ll begin with &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; example of fascism, Germany. And actually, this doesn&amp;#39;t need much explanation. The time gap between Hitler&amp;#39;s rise to power in the 1930s and modern day Germany in 2025 is basically a second historically, not even 100 years. Germany didn&amp;#39;t just have fears of fascism, they slid directly into it and became &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; case example studied everywhere. Look at where they&amp;#39;re at now. Those same major cities, Berlin, Frankfurt, etc are still there. Borders of core German area are still in tact and pretty much as they were prior Austria&amp;#39;s annexation. Population increased. And economy and industry, while only revived because of help at first, is now one of the best in the world. So we know for a definitive fact beyond all fear mongering, reasonable doubt, and hopelessness that even when the worst actually literally does come to worst, a nation can come back, prevail, and exist and thrive in the future. No American in the last 100 years has lived under a government that came even close to what Hitler&amp;#39;s became. Next.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;China. Again, it&amp;#39;s a pretty open and shut argument. What Mao did to his population in numbers makes anything that Hitler, Leopold, and Stalin did, numbers wise, look elementary. The consensus estimate is 15-55M of deaths, with the number 40M being used quite a bit. In other words, too many to actually count. And yet this happened in 1950-60s, and we&amp;#39;re in 2025, so an even &lt;em&gt;shorter&lt;/em&gt; time gap than Germany. Where is China now? Well, this writing is about continued survival of nations, which is dependent on stability and human life. It&amp;#39;s not about non-lethal civil rights abuses. I may despise the Chinese government, but in modern day, there are two nations who objectively lead the world in military might and industry. China is one of them.

I can understand why: the main reason these countries were even partitioned was on religious grounds. However, as we have seen in the decades since, India has had good relations with several Muslim-majority nations, such as Bangladesh, Maldives and the Middle-Eastern countries. Both countries have close ties to the United Kingdom, their former coloniser.\n\nI think that the issue of the princely states was the core reason for the wars between India and Pakistan.\n\nBy the time India and Pakistan gained their independence, they were functioning nations with heavily armed militaries and politically mobilised populations. To add to that, the political elite in both nations saw the princely states as antiquated entities. Giving them the ability to choose to whom they would accede was an added layer on this recipe for disaster.\n\nOne example of such a curious case is that of Jodhpur, which, despite having a Hindu ruler and Hindu population, considered joining Pakistan in exchange for access to ports and grain. The legal obscurity around this and the ignoring of the geopolitical reality of the two independent nations eventually caused the Junagadh situation and finally the issue in Kashmir, which led to the first war between the two independent nations.\n\nWhile I think partition was unavailable by mid-1947, had the proposed borders also included the princely states, the new states could have had a more friendly relationship. In this proposal, princely states that were contiguous to the newly created states should have been partitioned as Hindu-majority and Muslim-majority territories, similar to how Bengal and Punjab were partitioned. (Hence, Hyderabad and Junagadh would have naturally joined India, Kalat would have joined Pakistan, and Jammu and Kashmir would be partitioned between India and Pakistan based on their Hindu and Muslim populations.)\n\nThis clarity would not help the millions of people who were displaced due to partition and would not avoid the humanitarian crisis, but it would ensure there would be no war in the upcoming years, and perhaps could have led to a peaceful South Asian bloc as well.",

Giving them the ability to choose to whom they would accede was an added layer on this recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One example of such a curious case is that of Jodhpur, which, despite having a Hindu ruler and Hindu population, considered joining Pakistan in exchange for access to ports and grain. The legal obscurity around this and the ignoring of the geopolitical reality of the two independent nations eventually caused the Junagadh situation and finally the issue in Kashmir, which led to the first war between the two independent nations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I think partition was unavailable by mid-1947, had the proposed borders also included the princely states, the new states could have had a more friendly relationship. In this proposal, princely states that were contiguous to the newly created states should have been partitioned as Hindu-majority and Muslim-majority territories, similar to how Bengal and Punjab were partitioned. (Hence, Hyderabad and Junagadh would have naturally joined India, Kalat would have joined Pakistan, and Jammu and Kashmir would be partitioned between India and Pakistan based on their Hindu and Muslim populations.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This clarity would not help the millions of people who were displaced due to partition and would not avoid the humanitarian crisis, but it would ensure there would be no war in the upcoming years, and perhaps could have led to a peaceful South Asian bloc as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "**EDIT: I should've been clearer in my title - this CMV IS NOT about VOLUNTARY organ donation, it's about the commercial sale of organs.**\n\nTo be clear, I'm not necessarily saying that organ ~~donations~~ sales **should** be illegal; arguments about why it should be legal aren't really going to change my mind here. I'm also not going to be persuaded by the \"well there are plenty of other comparable, legal forms of risky, bodily exploitation under capitalism\" argument - if that is the case, then we should be banning **more** things that meet our justification for preventing organ sales, not shrugging and allowing all forms of comparable exploitation. As an example, my arguments might suggest that paying for plasma or participating in medical trials should also be illegal - if the logic holds and they are morally comparable, then yes, those might need to be illegal for moral consistency.\n\nThe crux of the issue is that doesn't make any logical sense to me why every country in the world would ban selling almost all organs as commodities, but a handful of them (including my home in the US) allow women to be paid for the use of their reproductive organs to gestate and birth a child. In other words, the justifications for limiting commercial organ sales hold when applied to commercial surrogacy (if not more so), **so if one is illegal, then they both should be.** Why? Let's start with the basic arguments against the sale of organs.\n\n1. **Removing an organ entails a significant life-threatening risk.** Any form of surgery exposes someone to the risk of infection, surgical complications, chronic health issues, and/or death. The risks may be relatively low, but it is absolutely the case that they could kill or severely harm you.\n2. **The only time people should be allowed to take significant life-threatening risks is with their fully informed, free consent.** Look, I get it. There are all kinds of potentially dangerous things that people want to do for one reason or another, and we shouldn't just ban all of them. The general social principle we have adopted is that people are allowed to assess those risks and make a personal calculation about whether to accept them. However, this is predicated on them understanding what they are signing up for/possibly risking (being informed), being capable of making decisions to begin with (e.g. not being impaired or a child), and not predicated on coercion (e.g. a contract signed with a gun to my head is not a valid contract).\n3. **The commercial sale of organs inevitably creates markets for those organs that pay the minimum amount possible for them.** This is usually the first and most obvious reason to ban the sale of organs. Given the risks of giving up an organ, people aren't going to do it unless they are compensated, and people with the means to afford an organ are going to find the amount of money that will induce someone to take that risk. This is no different from any other market - I want something I don't have and someone else does have it, but I have money they need, and so we make a deal. When we consider that getting an organ is literally a life-or-death necessity, it is perfectly reasonable to suspect that, absent regulation/bans, a for-profit market **will** emerge. The price of those organs will follow the pattern set in every other market - people with the supply will try to get as much money as possible, but the people with the demand only want to spend as much as they need to get it.\n4. **The people willing to take the risks of organ donation in exchange for money are going to be desperate, which blurs their consent.** Most people aren't looking to give up an organ for a living. It's painful, difficult, incurs serious risks, and just isn't as appealing to people as other ways to earn money. The existence of a whole range of hazardous fields proves that people are willing to risk their health and safety if the price is \"right\" - there is a reason that the majority of miners and sex workers globally are drawn from the poorest sectors of society. Given an alternative, most people don't choose these physically risky jobs unless they have to due to necessity. When the \"choice\" is destitution/death or doing something you don't want to, people who select the latter are doing so out of coercion, which means they aren't freely consenting.  Moreover, the incentives for people to serve as middlemen within a market like sex work in order to profit themselves create situations where people have an incentive to claim their \"worker\" is consenting in order to continue to profit from a client who might hesitate if they knew someone was being forced. Pimping and sex trafficking is highly lucrative, and we have every reason to believe that middlemen would exist to connect organ buyers with organ sellers who might be consenting in order to make money for themselves, without taking on any of the physical risks.\n5. **A system that allows for organ sales will further inequity in healthcare and society, and cut into donations.** The people who are going to be able to afford organs are going to be those wealthy enough to afford them. A person who previously thought about donating for altruistic reasons would have a strong incentive to profit off the exchange instead. Need a kidney? Better hope you're wealthy, or there's no way you are going to be able to afford one when you're competing with rich people at the same time. And who are the people who are going to giving up their organs? Those who are willing to part with them for the least amount of money, as the market will gravitate towards them. It won't just be poor people - it will be the very poorest of the poor, in the poorest parts of the world, taking on health risks and dangers that richer populations wouldn't be willing to accept because the alternative of brutal poverty is so awful. And if there are complications and the money you made evaporates when you can't work and have your own medical bills? Sucks to be you.\n6. **Alternative options exist.** Specifically, a donation from the deceased. We have the ability to give people the organs they need to survive without creating a nightmare hellscape of bodily capitalism by harvesting healthy organs from people who die. There are even things we can do to strengthen these systems (by using opt-out donation schemes rather than opt-in ones, for example). If literally the only possible way to save someone who needs a kidney was to get it from someone alive, this might be a different conversation. Since it isn't, creating a market isn't a necessity. Also, voluntary donations without a profit motive do also exist.\n\nSo...does that hold for commercial surrogacy? Yes, and then some.\n\n1. **Being pregnant is very physically risky.** Gestation to term and childbirth are potentially life-threatening medical conditions. Millions of women suffer major health issues or die every year due to pregnancy - it is not a neutral physical state, but a highly dangerous one. If anything, it is *more* dangerous than organ donation - about 10 in 100,000 kidney donors die within 90 days, but 32.9 in 100,000 mothers die in childbirth.\n2. **Consent is an essential part of whether a pregnancy is considered acceptable or immoral.** Setting aside the most staunchly anti-abortion views, it is pretty widely held that a woman being pregnant against her will is repugnant. Children who are impregnated, people held in sexual slavery, victims of sexual assault, and others are not usually held to have freely signed up for their ordeal, and there are a whole host of laws designed to prevent that from happening and to allow a woman impregnated against her will to get out the situation via abortion.\n3. **Commercial surrogacy is a massive, international market.** Only a handful of countries allow for commercial surrogacy, yet the market for it generated $14 billion in 2022. While surrogates in the US might cost as much as $200,000, you can hire a woman from Southeast Asia for a fraction of that, and many, many people do.\n4. **Commercial surrogates are usually poor, and there is a sprawling system to manage and connect them to buyers.** Remember that $200,000 a person might pay an American surrogate? Most of that money isn't going to the surrogate herself - people need to pay the agencies that find these women, the clinics that will impregnate them, the legal fees for adopting the baby, and in most cases *the medical insurance for the surrogate who likely didn't have it before.* Why don't most surrogates have insurance to begin with? Because they aren't people with great options to begin with. The surrogate is barely clearing $80,000 when it's all said and done; every other cost they bear (including any future medical costs post-partum) is on them. If that seems like a massive windfall, consider how poorly most lottery winners do with their sudden earnings. Add to that the fact that international surrogates are making a fraction of what Americans are, and the problems of desperation multiply.\n5. **Commercial surrogacy is exploding in parts of the world with women desperate enough to need it.**  Until India and Thailand cracked down on international commercial surrogacy, it was a major destination for Westerners looking to rent a womb on the cheap.  Now that demand has moved to Southeast Asian countries with low incomes and desperate women. This only entrenches the exploitation of the developing world by those with the money to take what they want from people without better options.\n6. **Having a child is not a mortal necessity, and alternatives exist for those who do want one.** People don't need to have kids, they want to. You won't die without one, as much as it might be something you want. And if you do want kids, you can always have them on your own, use reproductive technology like IVF on yourself to help get one, or adopt a child who already exists but isn't being cared for. You could also find someone willing to take on the risks as a voluntary surrogate.\n\nSo there it is, much longer than I initially thought. I'm sick and tired of seeing opposition to commercial surrogacy framed as inherently homophobic, anti-family, or misogynistic because it would limit women's choices. On an (almost) global level, we have decided that despite a genuinely lifesaving need for organs, allowing the commercial sale of them would create unacceptable situations and externalities. Most of the planet carries that logic forward when it comes to reproductive organs, and I do not believe it is logically and morally inconsistent for countries like the US to make an exception for commercial surrogacy.

I&amp;#39;m also not going to be persuaded by the &amp;quot;well there are plenty of other comparable, legal forms of risky, bodily exploitation under capitalism&amp;quot; argument - if that is the case, then we should be banning &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; things that meet our justification for preventing organ sales, not shrugging and allowing all forms of comparable exploitation. As an example, my arguments might suggest that paying for plasma or participating in medical trials should also be illegal - if the logic holds and they are morally comparable, then yes, those might need to be illegal for moral consistency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The crux of the issue is that doesn&amp;#39;t make any logical sense to me why every country in the world would ban selling almost all organs as commodities, but a handful of them (including my home in the US) allow women to be paid for the use of their reproductive organs to gestate and birth a child.

The instant Buttercup sees it she squares up, fists cocked, ready to swing.\n   2. Minutes later, the Mayor calls about a bread-and-butter bank robbery. Princess tags along, totally botches the takedown, and nearly gets civilians hurt. Same day, second time, Buttercup steps in again—*still* itching to throw hands.\n* **Day 3: Armor &amp; rag-dolling.** Princess, ego bruised beyond repair, rolls up in high-tech battle armor and starts trouble. Buttercup charges first…and gets rag-dolled across the Pokey Oaks schoolyard.\n\n# Why I Put the Blame on Buttercup\n\n1. **Opening posture = “No and fuck you for even asking.”** A kid in cosplay is not a capital-V villain. Buttercup’s Day-2 fury tells Princess the only path to respect is violence.\n2. **Missed leadership moment.** The girls have mentored outsiders before—Bunny in “Twisted Sister,” Robin in “Superfriends.” Buttercup skips that playbook and jumps straight to intimidation.\n3. **Self-fulfilling prophecy.** Treating Princess like an enemy before she’s broken a law practically writes her villain origin story.\n4. **Total clash with the show’s moral; Blossom spells it out.** After Princess loses on Day 3, Blossom lays down *the* creed: Blossom embodies the series’ “heart first, fists second” ethos—while Buttercup spends two straight days modeling the reverse: **“Because you’re just a spoiled brat. And being a Powerpuff Girl isn’t about getting your way, or having the best stuff, or being popular or powerful. It’s about using your own unique abilities to help people and the world we all live in. And you, little girl, have done nothing worthy of the name ‘Powerpuff.’**”\n\n# “Smarter” In-Universe Moves (Yes, They’d Make Boring TV)\n\n* Keep the unanimous “no,” but match Blossom’s diplomacy instead of Buttercup’s brawl-energy.\n* Lay out clear boundaries: “Train with the Professor, start with small rescues, *earn* the suit.”\n* After the botched robbery, escort her home and loop in her dad, no punches necessary.\n\nSure, any of that would shrink an 11-minute cartoon to a 30-second PSA, but inside Townsville logic they’re smarter and way more on-brand.\n\nButtercup’s fists-first diplomacy took a brat and forged a nemesis. **Convince me it was the right call.**",

The girls huddle and give a unanimous, civil “sorry, no.” Blossom does the talking; Buttercup mostly scowls.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Double meltdown.&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Princess returns in a knock-off Powerpuff costume. The instant Buttercup sees it she squares up, fists cocked, ready to swing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Minutes later, the Mayor calls about a bread-and-butter bank robbery. Princess tags along, totally botches the takedown, and nearly gets civilians hurt. Same day, second time, Buttercup steps in again—&lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; itching to throw hands.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: Armor &amp;amp; rag-dolling.&lt;/strong&gt; Princess, ego bruised beyond repair, rolls up in high-tech battle armor and starts trouble. Buttercup charges first…and gets rag-dolled across the Pokey Oaks schoolyard.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Why I Put the Blame on Buttercup&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening posture = “No and fuck you for even asking.”&lt;/strong&gt; A kid in cosplay is not a capital-V villain. Buttercup’s Day-2 fury tells Princess the only path to respect is violence.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missed leadership moment.&lt;/strong&gt; The girls have mentored outsiders before—Bunny in “Twisted Sister,” Robin in “Superfriends.” Buttercup skips that playbook and jumps straight to intimidation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/strong&gt; Treating Princess like an enemy before she’s broken a law practically writes her villain origin story.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total clash with the show’s moral; Blossom spells it out.&lt;/strong&gt; After Princess loses on Day 3, Blossom lays down &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; creed: Blossom embodies the series’ “heart first, fists second” ethos—while Buttercup spends two straight days modeling the reverse: &lt;strong&gt;“Because you’re just a spoiled brat. And being a Powerpuff Girl isn’t about getting your way, or having the best stuff, or being popular or powerful. It’s about using your own unique abilities to help people and the world we all live in. And you, little girl, have done nothing worthy of the name ‘Powerpuff.’&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;“Smarter” In-Universe Moves (Yes, They’d Make Boring TV)&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keep the unanimous “no,” but match Blossom’s diplomacy instead of Buttercup’s brawl-energy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lay out clear boundaries: “Train with the Professor, start with small rescues, &lt;em&gt;earn&lt;/em&gt; the suit.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;After the botched robbery, escort her home and loop in her dad, no punches necessary.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, any of that would shrink an 11-minute cartoon to a 30-second PSA, but inside Townsville logic they’re smarter and way more on-brand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buttercup’s fists-first diplomacy took a brat and forged a nemesis. &lt;strong&gt;Convince me it was the right call.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

If i hold a ball over a river and release it, then destroy the ball on the grounds that it chose to get wet, how is that any different from what most theistic religions are suggesting today?\nPerhaps this would fly if we could just assume God were a wicked person by nature, but these religions define God as a fundamentally fair, loving, benevolent, merciful god who somehow still allows souls to suffer in hell for all eternity despite the fact that he orchestrated it all.\n\nI did my research and found out that there are multiple theological stances that try to reconcile our free will and reward/punishment with God's \"omni\" qualities, but they never seem to be able to pair True Omniscience and True Omnipotence together and also always just sound like extreme speculation you'd hear from a star wars fan trying to explain what COULD be. Creating a huge and complex framework from very little to no evidence in the \"original text\" that supports said framework makes it feel like i'm just looking at writers desperately trying to fix plotholes somebody else created.\n\n Im not trying to mock anybody's belief system, this is something that genuinely disturbs me but wont be answered in real life because everyone around me will say “you are listening to the devil” when i ask them about it. I say this as somebody who has been raised by dogmatic west african christianity that immediately disparages any sort of inquisition as the voice of satan.

          "selftext": "My stance is quite simple, we are not our body, not even our brain.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n- There is no unique non fungible aspect of this body which could not be theoretically recreated. For example, the idea of teleporting from point A to point B, disassembled atomically and remade with atoms somewhere else in the same configuration with all of the same pathways in the brain, electrical charges and chemical reactions at the same values. \n\n- We can also imagine this by thinking of transcendence, if our consciousness is a result of our brain and the world is deterministic, we could recreate the brain and produce the same results it’s pattern would normally produce, therefore we could upload “you” into a computer. \n\n- We have the famous Ship of Thesus, at what point do you stop being you? I argue, both ships are equally the Ship of Thesus. What matters is the pattern, the structure, the concept. Same parameters, same thing. \n\n- If I was copied now, and recreated 10,000 years in the future, from “my” perspective I would have teleported and time traveled. \n\nSo what am I? I am a form of logic, an abstract object which can be instantiated by any physical object which sufficiently matches my pattern. Like a flower, nautilus shell or even galaxy representing the Fibbonacci Sequence. The same way a whole open world game can be represented by bits, or scratches in a CD. We wouldn’t say a video game is an unmarked CD, it is the grooves, the pattern represented on it. Likewise we are the grooves and values that are ingrained on our brain, which is simply the host of who we are. That is what we are, we are a certain value which can be reinstantiated. \n\nSomewhat similar to Plato’s world of Ideals, this body is me, because it is cast by the shadow of the Ideal me, the pattern that I am. Technically we could just say, since this body coincidentally matches my pattern, it is an instance of me. I am this pile of dominos in the whole chain which the universe is, and anywhere in that chain which falls exactly like it has now, would also be me. \n\nThus, we are a soul, not a body. That soul, is our very logic, our pattern. Anything that does or does not every single thing I would or wouldn’t do and for every reason I would or wouldn’t do it, is me.\n\nTo change my view, simply I require some sort of non fungible aspect of this specific life or body which could not theoretically be recreated. Something unique to this body which nothing could ever feasibly replicate, now or in the future. ",

For example, the idea of teleporting from point A to point B, disassembled atomically and remade with atoms somewhere else in the same configuration with all of the same pathways in the brain, electrical charges and chemical reactions at the same values. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can also imagine this by thinking of transcendence, if our consciousness is a result of our brain and the world is deterministic, we could recreate the brain and produce the same results it’s pattern would normally produce, therefore we could upload “you” into a computer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have the famous Ship of Thesus, at what point do you stop being you? I argue, both ships are equally the Ship of Thesus. What matters is the pattern, the structure, the concept. Same parameters, same thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I was copied now, and recreated 10,000 years in the future, from “my” perspective I would have teleported and time traveled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what am I? I am a form of logic, an abstract object which can be instantiated by any physical object which sufficiently matches my pattern. Like a flower, nautilus shell or even galaxy representing the Fibbonacci Sequence. The same way a whole open world game can be represented by bits, or scratches in a CD. We wouldn’t say a video game is an unmarked CD, it is the grooves, the pattern represented on it. Likewise we are the grooves and values that are ingrained on our brain, which is simply the host of who we are. That is what we are, we are a certain value which can be reinstantiated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhat similar to Plato’s world of Ideals, this body is me, because it is cast by the shadow of the Ideal me, the pattern that I am. Technically we could just say, since this body coincidentally matches my pattern, it is an instance of me. I am this pile of dominos in the whole chain which the universe is, and anywhere in that chain which falls exactly like it has now, would also be me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, we are a soul, not a body. That soul, is our very logic, our pattern. Anything that does or does not every single thing I would or wouldn’t do and for every reason I would or wouldn’t do it, is me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To change my view, simply I require some sort of non fungible aspect of this specific life or body which could not theoretically be recreated. Something unique to this body which nothing could ever feasibly replicate, now or in the future. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I was contemplating buying a new phone this past week with a friend. We both studied climate change in some capacity in university. I told her that I should try to source my phone from a responsible producer who upcycles electronics rather than getting an entirely new phone that would contribute to lithium mining, which I view as an unjust practice, as we already have enough lithium for our electronic gadget desires. She said that it was not my responsibility to spearhead lithium recycling programs in South America (where we we've been backpacking for the past year) through consumer choices. I objected by saying \"why would a company or government be compelled to give me a recycled phone if I as a consumer don't express a desire for this product?\" \n\nOf course, I had made the assumption that a government cares about my consumer choices, which is why I am attempting to argue from a place of MORALITY. What moral right do I have to demand that my government put in the effort if I myself do not put in the effort? Or perhaps a better question: why should the government care about climate change if I show them that I myself do not care about climate change through my actions? \n\nAnd even more, if individuals believe that what they do don't matter, we're totally screwed. We need people who are motivated to making a difference, and I see an apathy for individual action as a slippery slope to apathy for collective action, which, as someone who has participated in collective organizing, is a hell of a step above individual action in terms of the energy and what is expected from organizers. \n\nPlease change my view, \nSincerely,\nA mentally exhausted individual ",

Or that getting nervous before a big presentation means you have an anxiety disorder? I swear every other person I know is self-diagnosing with something based on TikTok videos or online quizzes.\n\nMy little cousin told me last week that she thinks she has ADHD because she gets distracted during boring classes. I'm like... yeah, that's called being a teenager in algebra class, not a neurological condition. But now she's convinced there's something wrong with her brain instead of just accepting that some stuff is tedious.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on how everything is \"trauma\" now. Your parents made you do chores? Trauma. Your teacher was strict? Trauma. Someone was mean to you in middle school? Trauma. Like, I get that actual trauma is real and serious, but we've watered down the term so much that it's lost all meaning.\n\nI think this whole thing is actually making people more fragile, not less. Instead of learning that uncomfortable emotions are normal and temporary, we're teaching people that feeling bad means something is medically wrong with them. So instead of developing coping skills, people just assume they need therapy or medication for every little thing.\n\nAnd the worst part is that this probably makes it harder for people with actual mental health conditions to get taken seriously. When everyone claims to have anxiety or depression, it becomes background noise instead of a real signal that someone needs help.\n\nI'm not saying mental health isn't real - obviously it is. Depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, all that stuff is absolutely real and serious. This is coming from someone who has mental issues herself. But I think we've gone way too far in the other direction where we're medicalizing normal human experiences.\n\nLike, sometimes you're just having a bad day. Sometimes you're stressed because your life is actually stressful. Sometimes you're sad because sad things happened. That's not a disorder, that's just being human.",

But now she&amp;#39;s convinced there&amp;#39;s something wrong with her brain instead of just accepting that some stuff is tedious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don&amp;#39;t even get me started on how everything is &amp;quot;trauma&amp;quot; now. Your parents made you do chores? Trauma. Your teacher was strict? Trauma. Someone was mean to you in middle school? Trauma. Like, I get that actual trauma is real and serious, but we&amp;#39;ve watered down the term so much that it&amp;#39;s lost all meaning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this whole thing is actually making people more fragile, not less. Instead of learning that uncomfortable emotions are normal and temporary, we&amp;#39;re teaching people that feeling bad means something is medically wrong with them. So instead of developing coping skills, people just assume they need therapy or medication for every little thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the worst part is that this probably makes it harder for people with actual mental health conditions to get taken seriously. When everyone claims to have anxiety or depression, it becomes background noise instead of a real signal that someone needs help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying mental health isn&amp;#39;t real - obviously it is. Depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, all that stuff is absolutely real and serious. This is coming from someone who has mental issues herself. But I think we&amp;#39;ve gone way too far in the other direction where we&amp;#39;re medicalizing normal human experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, sometimes you&amp;#39;re just having a bad day. Sometimes you&amp;#39;re stressed because your life is actually stressful. Sometimes you&amp;#39;re sad because sad things happened. That&amp;#39;s not a disorder, that&amp;#39;s just being human.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

During COVID, I lost track of her and only rediscovered her after COVID, when she already focused on other issues. Nowadays, I view her rhetorics (including the rhetorics from back then) as rather provocative and not as support-able for me personally compared to back then (i.e. How dare you!).\n\nRegarding the conflict, I am neither pro-Israel nor pro-Palestine, I like having civil discussions about it from time to time, but regarding activism / protests, I like to keep myself out of it, due to the massively complicated nature of the conflict. I hold the suspicion though, that most people who are discussing this conflict and going to protests have too little knowledge of what they are talking about, are missinformed or poorly informed.\n\nNow, the opinion of this post is: \"Being intercepted by Israel on her way to Gaza prevented Greta Thunberg and her crew from a worse fate.\"\n\nFrom what I perceived, the picture Greta is having / wants to paint of the situation in Gaza is that its an area inhabited only by civilians that are getting oppressed and starved by Israels military. That way, sailing to Gaza in order to deliver aid by boat seems to be a reasonable way of activism, but doesn't she ignore the fact that Hamas is still existing in Gaza? Did she have a plan on what would happen if Hamas takes her and her crew in captivity or worse? From what I have heard (could be pro-Israel sources though), Hamas has been stealing food aid that was delivered to Gaza. It would therefore be reasonable to think that her aid would also be stolen by Hamas.\n\nOf course, nobody can know what would have been if she actually made it to Gaza, but I really feel like the risk of her and her crew being captured by Hamas and kept hostage or used for PR reasons is rather high. One doesn't even want to think about other outcomes, given what Hamas did to women on Oct7.\n\nAfter her interception by Israel, a lot of people on the internet state how outrageous this interception of the boat is and speculate on how long she will be kept as a hostage in Israel, which is something I cannot deny, ofc. Only time will tell, but in my opinion Israel wouldn't profit from keeping her imprisoned which would only spark more public outrage. And regarding Greta and her crew, I feel like they saved them from a much grimmer fate.\n\nThanks for reading &lt;3",
