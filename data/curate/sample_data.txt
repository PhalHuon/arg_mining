Post 1: CMV: I genuinely can't trust Israel on whatever they say anymore
Author: ExtremeAcceptable289Post Text: So I've been keeping up with Palestine news lately, and it's come to my attention that I feel I just can't trust Israel on anything anymore, even though it'd be absurd to not trust them just because.

They've lied on so many thing it's crazy:

Shereen Abu Akleh

The 40 beheaded babies (they also got Biden to lie about it)

The flour massacre

The al-shifa hospital incident in which an Israeli impersonated an al-Shifa doctor along with the edited video after Nov 2023 siege

The al-Ahli hospital faked voice call

The 15 executed aid workers 

Hamas stealing aid (turns out an israeli funded gang did it)

The many, many times of "Palewood" lies (in which they later retacted/got debunked)

The gaza ministry of health being lies

The numbers of Hamas millitants dead (American intelligence and independent org says it is way less, and the number they claim is actually the number of males &gt;15)

Hamas shooting people trying to get aid 

The white phosphorus

Even things that should be trusted like the clips they send I just cant trust.
