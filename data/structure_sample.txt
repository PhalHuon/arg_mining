A tiny class of merchants, aristocrats, and state bureaucrats profited. The average European didn’t see any real benefit. If colonialism made all Europeans rich, why were most of them living in overcrowded tenements and dying of disease during the height of imperialism?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Europe’s wealth came from industrialization, technological innovation, capitalist reform, education systems, and functional institutions, not looting gold from Latin America or extracting rubber in Africa. Those things padded the pockets of empires, but they weren’t the foundation of broad-based economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People love to throw around colonialism as a one-size-fits-all excuse for everything wrong in the Global South and everything right in the West. But that narrative erases internal factors, governance, leadership, reform, culture, that actually matter far more over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

But lately, I've been wondering if we're taking it so far that we're actually making it harder to create real change, especially when it comes to social justice.\n\nTake climate activism, for example. I love that people are passionate about the environment, but sometimes it feels like we're splitting into smaller and smaller groups, vegans, zero-wasters, eco-anxious, you name it. Instead of working together, we end up arguing about who's doing it \"right,\" while the big polluters just keep doing their thing. It's like we're so busy perfecting our own eco-brand that we forget the real enemy.\n\nSocial media makes it even trickier. It's easy to get caught up in the aesthetics of activism, posting the right infographics, sharing the right hashtags, without actually doing much offline. Remember when everyone's feed went black for Blackout Tuesday? It looked powerful, but how many people actually followed up with action? Sometimes it feels like we're more interested in looking woke than actually making a difference.\n\nAnd then there's the empathy problem. When we're hyper-focused on our own struggles or identities, it can be hard to see what others are going through, even within the same movement. I've seen LGBTQ+ spaces turn into debates over who's \"more oppressed,\" instead of supporting each other's fights. It's like we're all competing for attention, instead of building each other up.\n\nBut if you look at the big wins in history, civil rights, marriage equality, even recent labor movements, they happened because people came together, found common ground, and fought as a team. Real change takes a crew, not just a bunch of solo acts doing their own thing.\n\nI'm not saying we should all be the same or ignore what makes us unique. But maybe we need to remember that social justice is about more than just self-expression, it's about solidarity, teamwork, and showing up for each other, even when it's not about us.\n\nTL;DR: Being unique is awesome, but if we only focus on ourselves, we're missing out on real progress.

They're actually missing something important.\n\nWhen your coworker asks, \"How's your weekend?\" they're not just filling the silence. They're checking your vibe - are you stressed, excited, distracted? That quick read tells them whether to approach you with a big project or just leave you alone to get your coffee first.\n\nThose few minutes of \"Nice weather today\" or \"Traffic was crazy\" do something subtle but valuable. They're like a social warm-up that says \"Hey, we're both here, we're both normal humans, and we can interact like civilized people.\" It makes everything else easier.\n\nThink about it - your random chats with the grocery clerk, your neighbor, or the security guard at work might seem forgettable, but they're building something. These casual connections are often the ones who mention job openings, help you when you're in a pinch, or just make your day a little brighter when you need it.\n\nAnd honestly? Making small talk when you're having a terrible day is actually good practice. It teaches you how to function socially even when you don't feel like it, which is a surprisingly useful life skill.\n\nPlus, taking thirty seconds to acknowledge another person's existence is just... nice. It's a tiny moment of human connection that costs nothing but makes both people feel a little more seen.\n\nThe people who think they're too intellectual for small talk often end up isolated, missing out on the web of casual relationships that actually make life richer and communities stronger.",

They&amp;#39;re actually missing something important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When your coworker asks, &amp;quot;How&amp;#39;s your weekend?&amp;quot; they&amp;#39;re not just filling the silence. They&amp;#39;re checking your vibe - are you stressed, excited, distracted? That quick read tells them whether to approach you with a big project or just leave you alone to get your coffee first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those few minutes of &amp;quot;Nice weather today&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Traffic was crazy&amp;quot; do something subtle but valuable. They&amp;#39;re like a social warm-up that says &amp;quot;Hey, we&amp;#39;re both here, we&amp;#39;re both normal humans, and we can interact like civilized people.&amp;quot; It makes everything else easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about it - your random chats with the grocery clerk, your neighbor, or the security guard at work might seem forgettable, but they&amp;#39;re building something. These casual connections are often the ones who mention job openings, help you when you&amp;#39;re in a pinch, or just make your day a little brighter when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And honestly? Making small talk when you&amp;#39;re having a terrible day is actually good practice. It teaches you how to function socially even when you don&amp;#39;t feel like it, which is a surprisingly useful life skill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, taking thirty seconds to acknowledge another person&amp;#39;s existence is just... nice. It&amp;#39;s a tiny moment of human connection that costs nothing but makes both people feel a little more seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people who think they&amp;#39;re too intellectual for small talk often end up isolated, missing out on the web of casual relationships that actually make life richer and communities stronger.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Let me be blunt: I believe social media is one of the most dangerous inventions in human history—and it's not just making us dumber or more distracted. It’s **radicalizing children, exploiting parents, dividing generations, incentivizing psychopathy, and being used as a geopolitical weapon to destabilize the United States.**\n\nAnd the worst part? We are barely reacting. We’re joking about it. Posting memes about it. Meanwhile, the damage is setting in so deeply that I genuinely fear for what the next 10–20 years will look like. I hope I’m wrong. CMV.\n\nHere’s my breakdown:\n\n# 1. Children are being addicted and psychologically exploited at scale.\n\nKids today are raised in a digital environment that operates like a **casino combined with a surveillance state.** Algorithms track their behavior, fingerprint their preferences, then serve content designed to **exploit their developing brains.** This isn't just overstimulation—it’s hijacking their dopamine systems.\n\n* **Microtransactions, loot boxes, gamified addiction loops**—we would have called them child gambling in the 2000s, but now they’re industry standard.\n* **Platforms like TikTok and YouTube** reward narcissism, body image obsession, and conformity to the most attention-grabbing trends.\n* Influencers like **Andrew Tate** speak directly to boys about dominance, women, and masculinity—and the algorithm pushes them further down those rabbit holes.\n\nWould you be okay with a 35-year-old man in a public park giving your 12-year-old son life advice about dominating women and masculinity? No? Then why is it okay when it’s on TikTok? Injected in your children brain relentlessly which they are hopelessly addicted to.\n\n# 2. Parents are overwhelmed and complicit without realizing it.\n\nParents are handing their kids digital devices like pacifiers. It starts with Cocomelon and evolves into algorithm-driven influencers, political content, toxic beauty standards, and consumerism all targeting children **before their frontal lobes are even close to fully developed.**\n\nMany parents are too exhausted to monitor content, especially while working full-time jobs in a broken economy. Others are just as addicted and manipulated as their kids—hooked on Facebook, doomscrolling, and TikTok escapism.\n\n# 3. Consumerism has merged with identity in deeply toxic ways.\n\nWe’ve entered a phase where identity is sold to us. You’re not just buying a product—you’re buying a personality, a tribe, a set of beliefs.\n\n* **Stanley Cups.** Sounds harmless, but the virality reveals something deeper: kids learning to equate **social belonging with consumer status.**\n* Influencers sell lifestyle, skincare, diets, politics. And they’re rewarded not for nuance or truth, but for **virality, extremism, and conformity.**\n* Every click trains the algorithm to place you into a **bubble**—a curated identity cluster, easily sold to and easily manipulated.\n\nWhat kind of long-term citizen does that produce?\n\n# 4. The algorithm is a propaganda machine—open for rent.\n\nOnce you’re profiled, **anyone** with money can inject messages into your feed. That includes corporations, extremist groups, foreign governments, even cults.\n\n* Repetition is persuasion. If you hear the same message from 10,000 accounts, **you will start to believe it.** It’s not a hypothesis—it’s psychological fact.\n* Foreign actors like **Russia and China** already know this. That’s why they’ve used platforms like Facebook and TikTok to inject propaganda, divide Americans, and destabilize our politics.\n* Do you really think it’s a coincidence that **Truth Social** and QAnon blew up on the same platforms that Russia was caught using to spread disinfo during 2016?\n\nThese systems weren’t designed for resilience. They were designed for addiction and profit. And **they’re wide open to manipulation**—not by hackers, but by advertisers.\n\n# 5. We are seeing the destruction of collective intelligence.\n\nWe’re now living through:\n\n* **All-time highs in youth depression, anxiety, and suicide.**\n* **Crashing test scores and attention spans.**\n* **Massive spikes in political extremism**—on both the far-right *and* far-left.\n* **Incel culture surging.** Loneliness epidemic. Mass shootings.\n\nAnd yet our reaction is…what? Maybe a “screen time” feature on your iPhone? A mental health PSA? Meanwhile, TikTok remains fully operational and installed on millions of U.S. teens' phones—while China strictly limits usage for their own youth.\n\nYou think that’s accidental?\n\n# 6. Older generations were manipulated too—just differently.\n\nRemember when your parents or grandparents suddenly started supporting Russia over Ukraine?\n\nThat didn’t happen in a vacuum. It started with **Facebook News, Fox News amplification, and Russian propaganda disguised as memes and clickbait.**\n\nThey were profiled. They were targeted. And now we have boomers who genuinely believe Vladimir Putin is “anti-woke.”\n\nYou see, **propaganda doesn't need to be true—it just needs to be repeated and emotionally charged.** That’s why MAGA took hold. It became a religion. Capitalists cashed in. Fox News kept the fire alive for profit. Your relatives were radicalized and **you lost them. For gods sake our children are glorifying terrorist regimes. Boomers &amp; Zoomers**\n\n# 7. This is how empires fall. Not by bombs—but by information warfare.\n\nIf you're China, Russia, Iran, North Korea—how do you challenge U.S. global power?\n\nYou don’t nuke us. You don’t invade.\n\nYou **divide us.** Confuse us. Radicalize our youth. Weaponize our media. Undermine trust in every institution. Make us question the idea of “truth” itself.\n\nAnd the U.S.—built on open systems and capitalist incentives—makes it *easy.* Social media is the perfect vector. And greed prevents us from stopping it.\n\n&gt;**Pravda** means “truth” in Russian. That was the name of the Soviet propaganda paper. Now we have **Truth Social.** You think that’s coincidence?\n\n# So here’s my final claim:\n\n&gt;**Social media is not just harmful—it is structurally designed to addict, divide, radicalize, and destroy.**\n\n**Change My View.**\n\nPlease.\n\nI *want* to be wrong. I want to believe there’s hope. That we can regulate this, or teach our way out of it, or that I’m catastrophizing. But the trends I see feel undeniable. Our youth are being exploited. Our elders were hijacked. And no one’s steering the ship.\n\nCan anyone honestly say this is sustainable?\n\nIf you disagree—tell me where I’m wrong. I’ll engage in good faith.\n\nBut if you agree, even partially… then what the hell are we doing?",

Children are being addicted and psychologically exploited at scale.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kids today are raised in a digital environment that operates like a &lt;strong&gt;casino combined with a surveillance state.&lt;/strong&gt; Algorithms track their behavior, fingerprint their preferences, then serve content designed to &lt;strong&gt;exploit their developing brains.&lt;/strong&gt; This isn&amp;#39;t just overstimulation—it’s hijacking their dopamine systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microtransactions, loot boxes, gamified addiction loops&lt;/strong&gt;—we would have called them child gambling in the 2000s, but now they’re industry standard.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platforms like TikTok and YouTube&lt;/strong&gt; reward narcissism, body image obsession, and conformity to the most attention-grabbing trends.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Influencers like &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Tate&lt;/strong&gt; speak directly to boys about dominance, women, and masculinity—and the algorithm pushes them further down those rabbit holes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would you be okay with a 35-year-old man in a public park giving your 12-year-old son life advice about dominating women and masculinity? No? Then why is it okay when it’s on TikTok? Injected in your children brain relentlessly which they are hopelessly addicted to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;2. Parents are overwhelmed and complicit without realizing it.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Parents are handing their kids digital devices like pacifiers. It starts with Cocomelon and evolves into algorithm-driven influencers, political content, toxic beauty standards, and consumerism all targeting children &lt;strong&gt;before their frontal lobes are even close to fully developed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many parents are too exhausted to monitor content, especially while working full-time jobs in a broken economy. Others are just as addicted and manipulated as their kids—hooked on Facebook, doomscrolling, and TikTok escapism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;3. Consumerism has merged with identity in deeply toxic ways.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ve entered a phase where identity is sold to us. You’re not just buying a product—you’re buying a personality, a tribe, a set of beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Cups.&lt;/strong&gt; Sounds harmless, but the virality reveals something deeper: kids learning to equate &lt;strong&gt;social belonging with consumer status.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Influencers sell lifestyle, skincare, diets, politics. And they’re rewarded not for nuance or truth, but for &lt;strong&gt;virality, extremism, and conformity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Every click trains the algorithm to place you into a &lt;strong&gt;bubble&lt;/strong&gt;—a curated identity cluster, easily sold to and easily manipulated.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What kind of long-term citizen does that produce?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;4. The algorithm is a propaganda machine—open for rent.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you’re profiled, &lt;strong&gt;anyone&lt;/strong&gt; with money can inject messages into your feed. That includes corporations, extremist groups, foreign governments, even cults.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Repetition is persuasion. If you hear the same message from 10,000 accounts, &lt;strong&gt;you will start to believe it.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not a hypothesis—it’s psychological fact.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Foreign actors like &lt;strong&gt;Russia and China&lt;/strong&gt; already know this. That’s why they’ve used platforms like Facebook and TikTok to inject propaganda, divide Americans, and destabilize our politics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do you really think it’s a coincidence that &lt;strong&gt;Truth Social&lt;/strong&gt; and QAnon blew up on the same platforms that Russia was caught using to spread disinfo during 2016?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These systems weren’t designed for resilience. They were designed for addiction and profit. And &lt;strong&gt;they’re wide open to manipulation&lt;/strong&gt;—not by hackers, but by advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;5. We are seeing the destruction of collective intelligence.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’re now living through:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-time highs in youth depression, anxiety, and suicide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crashing test scores and attention spans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massive spikes in political extremism&lt;/strong&gt;—on both the far-right &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; far-left.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incel culture surging.&lt;/strong&gt; Loneliness epidemic. Mass shootings.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet our reaction is…what? Maybe a “screen time” feature on your iPhone? A mental health PSA? Meanwhile, TikTok remains fully operational and installed on millions of U.S. teens&amp;#39; phones—while China strictly limits usage for their own youth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You think that’s accidental?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;6. Older generations were manipulated too—just differently.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember when your parents or grandparents suddenly started supporting Russia over Ukraine?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That didn’t happen in a vacuum. It started with &lt;strong&gt;Facebook News, Fox News amplification, and Russian propaganda disguised as memes and clickbait.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were profiled. They were targeted. And now we have boomers who genuinely believe Vladimir Putin is “anti-woke.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see, &lt;strong&gt;propaganda doesn&amp;#39;t need to be true—it just needs to be repeated and emotionally charged.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s why MAGA took hold. It became a religion. Capitalists cashed in. Fox News kept the fire alive for profit. Your relatives were radicalized and &lt;strong&gt;you lost them. For gods sake our children are glorifying terrorist regimes. Boomers &amp;amp; Zoomers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;7. This is how empires fall. Not by bombs—but by information warfare.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re China, Russia, Iran, North Korea—how do you challenge U.S. global power?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don’t nuke us. You don’t invade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;divide us.&lt;/strong&gt; Confuse us. Radicalize our youth. Weaponize our media. Undermine trust in every institution. Make us question the idea of “truth” itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the U.S.—built on open systems and capitalist incentives—makes it &lt;em&gt;easy.&lt;/em&gt; Social media is the perfect vector. And greed prevents us from stopping it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pravda&lt;/strong&gt; means “truth” in Russian. That was the name of the Soviet propaganda paper. Now we have &lt;strong&gt;Truth Social.&lt;/strong&gt; You think that’s coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;So here’s my final claim:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media is not just harmful—it is structurally designed to addict, divide, radicalize, and destroy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change My View.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be wrong. I want to believe there’s hope. That we can regulate this, or teach our way out of it, or that I’m catastrophizing. But the trends I see feel undeniable. Our youth are being exploited. Our elders were hijacked. And no one’s steering the ship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can anyone honestly say this is sustainable?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you disagree—tell me where I’m wrong. I’ll engage in good faith.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you agree, even partially… then what the hell are we doing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

You're supposed to stand on the left on elevators and in every situation where there are painted two-way paths/shared paths, the left will be the prescribed side.\n\nNow I've seen a lot of people walk on the right, and heard a lot of anecdotes on reddit of people here increasingly walking on the right, perhaps due to migration from right-walking countries. But I've never seen anyone say that walking on the right is the correct way to walk. Being a prescriptivist and not a descriptivist, I don't think the left-side norm has changed at all.\n\nI believe that, whenever you are walking towards a potential head-on collision, the first question you should ask yourself should be whether you are on the left. If you are, keep walking as if you have no plans to change course, but are happy taking up the space you're entitled to. If you are not walking on the left, then it is your responsibility to move to the left. Is the rest of the foot traffic on both sides walking on the right? Doesn't matter. You have the choice of continuing until the people in front of you move or following the flow of traffic if it seems impractical (provided that by doing so, you don't impeded anyone walking on the correct side). Is there a group ahead taking up the whole path? Go on the left side and take up the space you're entitled to until they move. You don't need to apologise or explain yourself. You don't need to read the flow of movement. Just move predictably, and take up your space.\n\n*Of course* there are exceptions for when there's many paths and people are walking across you, or when people are movement impaired in any way, or when some other obstacle makes it very difficult to change track. Of course there will be some level of light movement to preserve people's personal space. Of course some people find it easier and others find it harder to take up space in public. But the first and main determinant of what to do will always be- follow the broader norm.\n\nCMV",

I have this suspicion that in school, with testing and memorization you don't actually learn the language, you learn to translate stuff into your native tongue rather than speak the actual thing.\n\nWhen you think about it. You learn your first language by being exposed to it, relentlessly all the time. You don't actually need to know the grammar rules to communicate in that language, you just kind of know? Kind of, feel it? Did you learn the language by cramming grammar rules? Odds are you knew the grammar rules before you actually learned what they are, right?\n\nAnd then you go to school and they sit you down and hand you a grammar book as to make it the most boring and stressful tedious thing. But that was not how you learned your first one, was it?\n\nEDIT:\n\nMy view hasn't changed, perhaps I'm stubborn. Anyhow most of the disagreement comes with the \"Language takes much more effort to learn, it doesn't work the way it's done, but there's no other way to not teach someone something\" sauce. That itself is a different topic. I'd argue that there might be other things to teach, instead.\n\n  \nOnce you actually begin to pursue the language in your own time, you're stuck in lockstep with people that don't, so it's a waste of time for those who are interested and those who aren't. But that too, is a flaw within the educational system.",

I have this suspicion that in school, with testing and memorization you don&amp;#39;t actually learn the language, you learn to translate stuff into your native tongue rather than speak the actual thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you think about it. You learn your first language by being exposed to it, relentlessly all the time. You don&amp;#39;t actually need to know the grammar rules to communicate in that language, you just kind of know? Kind of, feel it? Did you learn the language by cramming grammar rules? Odds are you knew the grammar rules before you actually learned what they are, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then you go to school and they sit you down and hand you a grammar book as to make it the most boring and stressful tedious thing. But that was not how you learned your first one, was it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My view hasn&amp;#39;t changed, perhaps I&amp;#39;m stubborn. Anyhow most of the disagreement comes with the &amp;quot;Language takes much more effort to learn, it doesn&amp;#39;t work the way it&amp;#39;s done, but there&amp;#39;s no other way to not teach someone something&amp;quot; sauce. That itself is a different topic. I&amp;#39;d argue that there might be other things to teach, instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you actually begin to pursue the language in your own time, you&amp;#39;re stuck in lockstep with people that don&amp;#39;t, so it&amp;#39;s a waste of time for those who are interested and those who aren&amp;#39;t. But that too, is a flaw within the educational system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Magic was a coping mechanism — a way to create meaning and predictability in a chaotic world. Once better tools of inquiry came along, those magical explanations were replaced by natural ones. Even now, \"supernatural\" claims fall apart when subjected to scrutiny. Every time something that seems magical has been studied thoroughly—whether it's psychic powers, spiritual energy, or magical relics—it fails to stand up to repeated scientific testing.\n\nSo far, nothing has ever been proven to defy the known laws of nature.

I grew up in a city (Oakland, CA) that has now lost three of its teams in the last decade or so. It &lt;em&gt;sucks&lt;/em&gt;. Sports teams are one of the few institutions that can really cut across class and race lines and provide a source of pride and connection in the community, and losing them can be devastating. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All this is to say, if a team&amp;#39;s ownership presents a credible threat of leaving a city, the city should capitulate. They don&amp;#39;t have to like it, and they shouldn&amp;#39;t like it, but they should capitulate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
