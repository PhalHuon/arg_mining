    Data collection:
    run scraper.py

    Preprocess data
        only get the words
        remove punctuations, stopwords
        tokenize, lemmatize
        NLTK
        visualize
            frequency distribution
            extracting concordance - collection of word locations 
                how many times a word appear
                where each occurrence appear
                what words surround that word

    Sentiment analyzer
        binary sentiment
            positive vs negative
            positive, neutral, negative
        fine-grained emotion analysis(need more data)
            joy, anger, fear, etc 
            
    use nltk pretrained - SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
    polarity_scores()
    customize nltk sentiment analysis
